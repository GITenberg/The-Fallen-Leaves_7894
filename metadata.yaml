description: Victorian-era novelist Wilkie Collins was one of the most popular and
  successful writers of his day, ranked by some as equal in influence and acclaim
  to his friend and mentor Charles Dickens. Like Dickens, Collins' novels take a hard
  look at the social problems of the period in the context of an engaging, often addictively
  paced, narrative. Fallen Leaves recounts the lives of four women, each of whom has
  chosen a distinct path but whose fortunes are inextricably linked.
