    <p>
      Experience of the reception of <i>The Fallen Leaves</i> by intelligent
      readers, who have followed the course of the periodical publication at
      home and abroad, has satisfied me that the design of the work speaks for
      itself, and that the scrupulous delicacy of treatment, in certain portions
      of the story, has been as justly appreciated as I could wish. Having
      nothing to explain, and (so far as my choice of subject is concerned)
      nothing to excuse, I leave my book, without any prefatory pleading for it,
      to make its appeal to the reading public on such merits as it may possess.

    <h2>
      THE PROLOGUE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      The resistless influences which are one day to reign supreme over our poor
      hearts, and to shape the sad short course of our lives, are sometimes of
      mysteriously remote origin, and find their devious ways to us through the
      hearts and the lives of strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the young man whose troubled career it is here proposed to follow
      was wearing his first jacket, and bowling his first hoop, a domestic
      misfortune, falling on a household of strangers, was destined nevertheless
      to have its ultimate influence over his happiness, and to shape the whole
      aftercourse of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, some First Words must precede the Story, and must present
      the brief narrative of what happened in the household of strangers. By
      what devious ways the event here related affected the chief personage of
      these pages, when he grew to manhood, it will be the business of the story
      to trace, over land and sea, among men and women, in bright days and dull
      days alike, until the end is reached, and the pen (God willing) is put
      back in the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Benjamin Ronald (of the Stationers&rsquo; Company) took a young wife at the
      ripe age of fifty, and carried with him into the holy estate of matrimony
      some of the habits of his bachelor life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a bachelor, he had never willingly left his shop (situated in that
      exclusively commercial region of London which is called &ldquo;the City&rdquo;) from
      one year&rsquo;s end to another. As a married man, he persisted in following the
      same monotonous course; with this one difference, that he now had a woman
      to follow it with him. &ldquo;Travelling by railway,&rdquo; he explained to his wife,
      &ldquo;will make your head ache&mdash;it makes <i>my</i> head ache. Travelling
      by sea will make you sick&mdash;it makes <i>me</i> sick. If you want
      change of air, every sort of air is to be found in the City. If you admire
      the beauties of Nature, there is Finsbury Square with the beauties of
      Nature carefully selected and arranged. When we are in London, you (and I)
      are all right; and when we are out of London, you (and I) are all wrong.&rdquo;
       As surely as the autumn holiday season set in, so surely Old Ronald
      resisted his wife&rsquo;s petition for a change of scene in that form of words.
      A man habitually fortified behind his own inbred obstinacy and selfishness
      is for the most part an irresistible power within the limits of his
      domestic circle. As a rule, patient Mrs. Ronald yielded; and her husband
      stood revealed to his neighbours in the glorious character of a married
      man who had his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the autumn of 1856, the retribution which sooner or later descends
      on all despotisms, great and small, overtook the iron rule of Old Ronald,
      and defeated the domestic tyrant on the battle-field of his own fireside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children born of the marriage, two in number, were both daughters. The
      elder had mortally offended her father by marrying imprudently&mdash;in a
      pecuniary sense. He had declared that she should never enter his house
      again; and he had mercilessly kept his word. The younger daughter (now
      eighteen years of age) proved to be also a source of parental inquietude,
      in another way. She was the passive cause of the revolt which set her
      father&rsquo;s authority at defiance. For some little time past she had been out
      of health. After many ineffectual trials of the mild influence of
      persuasion, her mother&rsquo;s patience at last gave way. Mrs. Ronald insisted&mdash;yes,
      actually insisted&mdash;on taking Miss Emma to the seaside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; Old Ronald asked; detecting something that
      perplexed him in his wife&rsquo;s look and manner, on the memorable occasion
      when she asserted a will of her own for the first time in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of finer observation would have discovered the signs of no ordinary
      anxiety and alarm, struggling to show themselves openly in the poor
      woman&rsquo;s face. Her husband only saw a change that puzzled him. &ldquo;Send for
      Emma,&rdquo; he said, his natural cunning inspiring him with the idea of
      confronting the mother and daughter, and of seeing what came of <i>that.</i>
      Emma appeared, plump and short, with large blue eyes, and full pouting
      lips, and splendid yellow hair: otherwise, miserably pale, languid in her
      movements, careless in her dress, sullen in her manner. Out of health as
      her mother said, and as her father saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see for yourself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ronald, &ldquo;that the girl is pining for
      fresh air. I have heard Ramsgate recommended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Ronald looked at his daughter. She represented the one tender place in
      his nature. It was not a large place; but it did exist. And the proof of
      it is, that he began to yield&mdash;with the worst possible grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we will see about it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no time to be lost,&rdquo; Mrs. Ronald persisted. &ldquo;I mean to take her
      to Ramsgate tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ronald looked at his wife as a dog looks at the maddened sheep that
      turns on him. &ldquo;You mean?&rdquo; repeated the stationer. &ldquo;Upon my soul&mdash;what
      next? You mean? Where is the money to come from? Answer me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ronald declined to be drawn into a conjugal dispute, in the presence
      of her daughter. She took Emma&rsquo;s arm, and led her to the door. There she
      stopped, and spoke. &ldquo;I have already told you that the girl is ill,&rdquo; she
      said to her husband. &ldquo;And I now tell you again that she must have the sea
      air. For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t let us quarrel! I have enough to try me without
      that.&rdquo; She closed the door on herself and her daughter, and left her lord
      and master standing face to face with the wreck of his own outraged
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      What further progress was made by the domestic revolt, when the bedroom
      candles were lit, and the hour of retirement had arrived with the night,
      is naturally involved in mystery. This alone is certain: On the next
      morning, the luggage was packed, and the cab was called to the door. Mrs.
      Ronald spoke her parting words to her husband in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I have not expressed myself too strongly about taking Emma to the
      seaside,&rdquo; she said, in gentle pleading tones. &ldquo;I am anxious about our
      girl&rsquo;s health. If I have offended you&mdash;without meaning it, God knows!&mdash;say
      you forgive me before I go. I have tried honestly, dear, to be a good wife
      to you. And you have always trusted me, haven&rsquo;t you? And you trust me
      still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his lean cold hand, and pressed it fervently: her eyes rested on
      him with a strange mixture of timidity and anxiety. Still in the prime of
      her life, she preserved the personal attractions&mdash;the fair calm
      refined face, the natural grace of look and movement&mdash;which had made
      her marriage to a man old enough to be her father a cause of angry
      astonishment among all her friends. In the agitation that now possessed
      her, her colour rose, her eyes brightened; she looked for the moment
      almost young enough to be Emma&rsquo;s sister. Her husband opened his hard old
      eyes in surly bewilderment. &ldquo;Why need you make this fuss?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo; Mrs. Ronald shrank at those words as if he had
      struck her. She kissed him in silence, and joined her daughter in the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of that day, the persons in the stationer&rsquo;s employment had a
      hard time of it with their master in the shop. Something had upset Old
      Ronald. He ordered the shutters to be put up earlier that evening than
      usual. Instead of going to his club (at the tavern round the corner), he
      took a long walk in the lonely and lifeless streets of the City by night.
      There was no disguising it from himself; his wife&rsquo;s behaviour at parting
      had made him uneasy. He naturally swore at her for taking that liberty,
      while he lay awake alone in his bed. &ldquo;Damn the woman! What does she mean?&rdquo;
       The cry of the soul utters itself in various forms of expression. That was
      the cry of Old Ronald&rsquo;s soul, literally translated.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning brought him a letter from Ramsgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I write immediately to tell you of our safe arrival. We have found
      comfortable lodgings (as the address at the head of this letter will
      inform you) in Albion Place. I thank you, and Emma desires to thank you
      also, for your kindness in providing us with ample means for taking our
      little trip. It is beautiful weather today; the sea is calm, and the
      pleasure-boats are out. We do not of course expect to see you here. But if
      you do, by any chance, overcome your objection to moving out of London, I
      have a little request to make. Please let me hear of your visit beforehand&mdash;so
      that I may not omit all needful preparations. I know you dislike being
      troubled with letters (except on business), so I will not write too
      frequently. Be so good as to take no news for good news, in the intervals.
      When you have a few minutes to spare, you will write, I hope, and tell me
      how you and the shop are going on. Emma sends you her love, in which I beg
      to join.&rdquo; So the letter was expressed, and so it ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They needn&rsquo;t be afraid of my troubling them. Calm seas and
      pleasure-boats! Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; Such was the first impression which
      his wife&rsquo;s report of herself produced on Old Ronald&rsquo;s mind. After a while,
      he looked at the letter again&mdash;and frowned, and reflected. &ldquo;Please
      let me hear of your visit beforehand,&rdquo; he repeated to himself, as if the
      request had been, in some incomprehensible way, offensive to him. He
      opened the drawer of his desk, and threw the letter into it. When business
      was over for the day, he went to his club at the tavern, and made himself
      unusually disagreeable to everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed. In the interval he wrote briefly to his wife. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all
      right, and the shop goes on as usual.&rdquo; He also forwarded one or two
      letters which came for Mrs. Ronald. No more news reached him from
      Ramsgate. &ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;re enjoying themselves,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;The
      house looks queer without them; I&rsquo;ll go to the club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stayed later than usual, and drank more than usual, that night. It was
      nearly one in the morning when he let himself in with his latch-key, and
      went upstairs to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching the toilette-table, he found a letter lying on it, addressed
      to &ldquo;Mr. Ronald&mdash;private.&rdquo; It was not in his wife&rsquo;s handwriting; not
      in any handwriting known to him. The characters sloped the wrong way, and
      the envelope bore no postmark. He eyed it over and over suspiciously. At
      last he opened it, and read these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are advised by a true friend to lose no time in looking after your
      wife. There are strange doings at the seaside. If you don&rsquo;t believe me,
      ask Mrs. Turner, Number 1, Slains Row, Ramsgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No address, no date, no signature&mdash;an anonymous letter, the first he
      had ever received in the long course of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hard brain was in no way affected by the liquor that he had drunk. He
      sat down on his bed, mechanically folding and refolding the letter. The
      reference to &ldquo;Mrs. Turner&rdquo; produced no impression on him of any sort: no
      person of that name, common as it was, happened to be numbered on the list
      of his friends or his customers. But for one circumstance, he would have
      thrown the letter aside, in contempt. His memory reverted to his wife&rsquo;s
      incomprehensible behaviour at parting. Addressing him through that
      remembrance, the anonymous warning assumed a certain importance to his
      mind. He went down to his desk, in the back office, and took his wife&rsquo;s
      letter out of the drawer, and read it through slowly. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he said,
      pausing as he came across the sentence which requested him to write
      beforehand, in the unlikely event of his deciding to go to Ramsgate. He
      thought again of the strangely persistent way in which his wife had dwelt
      on his trusting her; he recalled her nervous anxious looks, her deepening
      colour, her agitation at one moment, and then her sudden silence and
      sudden retreat to the cab. Fed by these irritating influences, the inbred
      suspicion in his nature began to take fire slowly. She might be innocent
      enough in asking him to give her notice before he joined her at the
      seaside&mdash;she might naturally be anxious to omit no needful
      preparation for his comfort. Still, he didn&rsquo;t like it; no, he didn&rsquo;t like
      it. An appearance as of a slow collapse passed little by little over his
      rugged wrinkled face. He looked many years older than his age, as he sat
      at the desk, with the flaring candlelight close in front of him, thinking.
      The anonymous letter lay before him, side by side with his wife&rsquo;s letter.
      On a sudden, he lifted his gray head, and clenched his fist, and struck
      the venomous written warning as if it had been a living thing that could
      feel. &ldquo;Whoever you are,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He never even made the attempt to go to bed that night. His pipe helped
      him through the comfortless and dreary hours. Once or twice he thought of
      his daughter. Why had her mother been so anxious about her? Why had her
      mother taken her to Ramsgate? Perhaps, as a blind&mdash;ah, yes, perhaps
      as a blind! More for the sake of something to do than for any other
      reason, he packed a handbag with a few necessaries. As soon as the servant
      was stirring, he ordered her to make him a cup of strong coffee. After
      that, it was time to show himself as usual, on the opening of the shop. To
      his astonishment, he found his clerk taking down the shutters, in place of
      the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Where is Farnaby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk looked at his master, and paused aghast with a shutter in his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! what has come to you?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Ronald angrily repeated his question: &ldquo;Where is Farnaby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know? Have you been up to his bedroom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he isn&rsquo;t in his bedroom. And, what&rsquo;s more, his bed hasn&rsquo;t been
      slept in last night. Farnaby&rsquo;s off, sir&mdash;nobody knows where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Ronald dropped heavily into the nearest chair. This second mystery,
      following on the mystery of the anonymous letter, staggered him. But his
      business instincts were still in good working order. He held out his keys
      to the clerk. &ldquo;Get the petty cash-book,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and see if the money is
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk received the keys under protest. <i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s</i> not the right
      reading of the riddle,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk opened the money-drawer under the counter; counted the pounds,
      shillings and pence paid by chance customers up to the closing of the shop
      on the previous evening; compared the result with the petty cash-book, and
      answered, &ldquo;Right to a halfpenny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied so far, old Ronald condescended to approach the speculative side
      of the subject, with the assistance of his subordinate. &ldquo;If what you said
      just now means anything,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;it means that you suspect the
      reason why Farnaby has left my service. Let&rsquo;s hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I never liked John Farnaby,&rdquo; the clerk began. &ldquo;An active
      young fellow and a clever young fellow, I grant you. But a bad servant for
      all that. False, Mr. Ronald&mdash;false to the marrow of his bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ronald&rsquo;s patience began to give way. &ldquo;Come to the facts,&rdquo; he growled.
      &ldquo;Why has Farnaby gone off without a word to anybody? Do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know no more than you do,&rdquo; the clerk answered coolly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fly into a
      passion. I have got some facts for you, if you will only give me time.
      Turn them over in your own mind, and see what they come to. Three days ago
      I was short of postage-stamps, and I went to the office. Farnaby was
      there, waiting at the desk where they pay the post-office orders. There
      must have been ten or a dozen people with letters, orders, and what not,
      between him and me. I got behind him quietly, and looked over his
      shoulder. I saw the clerk give him the money for his post-office order.
      Five pounds in gold, which I reckoned as they lay on the counter, and a
      bank-note besides, which he crumpled up in his hand. I can&rsquo;t tell you how
      much it was for; I only know it <i>was</i> a bank-note. Just ask yourself
      how a porter on twenty shillings a week (with a mother who takes in
      washing, and a father who takes in drink) comes to have a correspondent
      who sends him an order for five sovereigns&mdash;and a bank-note, value
      unknown. Say he&rsquo;s turned betting-man in secret. Very good. There&rsquo;s the
      post-office order, in that case, to show that he&rsquo;s got a run of luck. If
      he has got a run of luck, tell me this&mdash;why does he leave his place
      like a thief in the night? He&rsquo;s not a slave; he&rsquo;s not even an apprentice.
      When he thinks he can better himself, he has no earthly need to keep it a
      secret that he means to leave your service. He may have met with an
      accident, to be sure. But that&rsquo;s not <i>my</i> belief. I say he&rsquo;s up to
      some mischief And now comes the question: What are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ronald, listening with his head down, and without interposing a word
      on his own part, made an extraordinary answer. &ldquo;Leave it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Leave
      it till tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; the clerk answered, without ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ronald made another extraordinary answer. &ldquo;Because I am obliged to go
      out of town for the day. Look after the business. The ironmonger&rsquo;s man
      over the way will help you to put up the shutters at night. If anybody
      inquires for me, say I shall be back tomorrow.&rdquo; With those parting
      directions, heedless of the effect that he had produced on the clerk, he
      looked at his watch, and left the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell which gave five minutes&rsquo; notice of the starting of the Ramsgate
      train had just rung.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the other travellers were hastening to the platform, two persons
      stood passively apart as if they had not even yet decided on taking their
      places in the train. One of the two was a smart young man in a cheap
      travelling suit; mainly noticeable by his florid complexion, his restless
      dark eyes, and his profusely curling black hair. The other was a
      middle-aged woman in frowsy garments; tall and stout, sly and sullen. The
      smart young man stood behind the uncongenial-looking person with whom he
      had associated himself, using her as a screen to hide him while he watched
      the travellers on their way to the train. As the bell rang, the woman
      suddenly faced her companion, and pointed to the railway clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you waiting to make up your mind till the train has gone?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man frowned impatiently. &ldquo;I am waiting for a person whom I
      expect to see,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;If the person travels by this train, we
      shall travel by it. If not, we shall come back here, and look out for the
      next train, and so on till night-time, if it&rsquo;s necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman fixed her small scowling gray eyes on the man as he replied in
      those terms. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; she broke out. &ldquo;I like to see my way before me.
      You&rsquo;re a stranger, young Mister; and it&rsquo;s as likely as not you&rsquo;ve given me
      a false name and address. That don&rsquo;t matter. False names are commoner than
      true ones, in my line of life. But mind this! I don&rsquo;t stir a step farther
      till I&rsquo;ve got half the money in my hand, and my return-ticket there and
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; the man suddenly interposed in a whisper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
      right. I&rsquo;ll get the tickets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked while he spoke at an elderly traveller, hastening by with his
      head down, deep in thought, noticing nobody. The traveller was Mr. Ronald.
      The young man, who had that moment recognized him, was his runaway porter,
      John Farnaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning with the tickets, the porter took his repellent travelling
      companion by the arm, and hurried her along the platform to the train.
      &ldquo;The money!&rdquo; she whispered, as they took their places. Farnaby handed it
      to her, ready wrapped up in a morsel of paper. She opened the paper,
      satisfied herself that no trick had been played her, and leaned back in
      her corner to go to sleep. The train started. Old Ronald travelled by the
      second class; his porter and his porter&rsquo;s companion accompanied him
      secretly by the third.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still early in the afternoon when Mr. Ronald descended the narrow
      street which leads from the high land of the South-Eastern railway station
      to the port of Ramsgate. Asking his way of the first policeman whom he
      met, he turned to the left, and reached the cliff on which the houses in
      Albion Place are situated. Farnaby followed him at a discreet distance;
      and the woman followed Farnaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in sight of the lodging-house, Mr. Ronald paused&mdash;partly to
      recover his breath, partly to compose himself. He was conscious of a
      change of feeling as he looked up at the windows: his errand suddenly
      assumed a contemptible aspect in his own eyes. He almost felt ashamed of
      himself. After twenty years of undisturbed married life, was it possible
      that he had doubted his wife&mdash;and that at the instigation of a
      stranger whose name even was unknown to him? &ldquo;If she was to step out in
      the balcony, and see me down here,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what a fool I should
      look!&rdquo; He felt half-inclined, at the moment when he lifted the knocker of
      the door, to put it back again quietly, and return to London. No! it was
      too late. The maid-servant was hanging up her birdcage in the area of the
      house; the maid-servant had seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Mrs. Ronald lodge here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl lifted her eyebrows and opened her mouth&mdash;stared at him in
      speechless confusion&mdash;and disappeared in the kitchen regions. This
      strange reception of his inquiry irritated him unreasonably. He knocked
      with the absurd violence of a man who vents his anger on the first
      convenient thing that he can find. The landlady opened the door, and
      looked at him in stern and silent surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Mrs. Ronald lodge here?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady answered with some appearance of effort&mdash;the effort of a
      person who was carefully considering her words before she permitted them
      to pass her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ronald has taken rooms here. But she has not occupied them yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not occupied them yet?&rdquo; The words bewildered him as if they had been
      spoken in an unknown tongue. He stood stupidly silent on the doorstep. His
      anger was gone; an all-mastering fear throbbed heavily at his heart. The
      landlady looked at him, and said to her secret self: &ldquo;Just what I
      suspected; there <i>is</i> something wrong!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have not sufficiently explained myself, sir,&rdquo; she resumed with
      grave politeness. &ldquo;Mrs. Ronald told me that she was staying at Ramsgate
      with friends. She would move into my house, she said, when her friends
      left&mdash;but they had not quite settled the day yet. She calls here for
      letters. Indeed, she was here early this morning, to pay the second week&rsquo;s
      rent. I asked when she thought of moving in. She didn&rsquo;t seem to know; her
      friends (as I understood) had not made up their minds. I must say I
      thought it a little odd. Would you like to leave any message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He recovered himself sufficiently to speak. &ldquo;Can you tell me where her
      friends live?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady shook her head. &ldquo;No, indeed. I offered to save Mrs. Ronald
      the trouble of calling here, by sending letters or cards to her present
      residence. She declined the offer&mdash;and she has never mentioned the
      address. Would you like to come in and rest, sir? I will see that your
      card is taken care of, if you wish to leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlady looked after him as he descended the house-steps. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
      husband, Peggy,&rdquo; she said to the servant, waiting inquisitively behind
      her. &ldquo;Poor old gentleman! And such a respectable-looking woman, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ronald walked mechanically to the end of the row of houses, and met
      the wide grand view of sea and sky. There were some seats behind the
      railing which fenced the edge of the cliff. He sat down, perfectly
      stupefied and helpless, on the nearest bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of life, the loss of a man&rsquo;s customary nourishment extends
      its debilitating influence rapidly from his body to his mind. Mr. Ronald
      had tasted nothing but his cup of coffee since the previous night. His
      mind began to wander strangely; he was not angry or frightened or
      distressed. Instead of thinking of what had just happened, he was thinking
      of his young days when he had been a cricket-player. One special game
      revived in his memory, at which he had been struck on the head by the
      ball. &ldquo;Just the same feeling,&rdquo; he reflected vacantly, with his hat off,
      and his hand on his forehead. &ldquo;Dazed and giddy&mdash;just the same
      feeling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back on the bench, and fixed his eyes on the sea, and wondered
      languidly what had come to him. Farnaby and the woman, still following,
      waited round the corner where they could just keep him in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue lustre of the sky was without a cloud; the sunny sea leapt under
      the fresh westerly breeze. From the beach, the cries of children at play,
      the shouts of donkey-boys driving their poor beasts, the distant notes of
      brass instruments playing a waltz, and the mellow music of the small waves
      breaking on the sand, rose joyously together on the fragrant air. On the
      next bench, a dirty old boatman was prosing to a stupid old visitor. Mr.
      Ronald listened, with a sense of vacant content in the mere act of
      listening. The boatman&rsquo;s words found their way to his ears like the other
      sounds that were abroad in the air. &ldquo;Yes; them&rsquo;s the Goodwin Sands, where
      you see the lightship. And that steamer there, towing a vessel into the
      harbour, that&rsquo;s the Ramsgate Tug. Do you know what I should like to see? I
      should like to see the Ramsgate Tug blow up. Why? I&rsquo;ll tell you why. I
      belong to Broadstairs; I don&rsquo;t belong to Ramsgate. Very well. I&rsquo;m idling
      here, as you may see, without one copper piece in my pocket to rub against
      another. What trade do I belong to? I don&rsquo;t belong to no trade; I belong
      to a boat. The boat&rsquo;s rotting at Broadstairs, for want of work. And all
      along of what? All along of the Tug. The Tug has took the bread out of our
      mouths: me and my mates. Wait a bit; I&rsquo;ll show you how. What did a ship
      do, in the good old times, when she got on them sands&mdash;Goodwin Sands?
      Went to pieces, if it come on to blow; or got sucked down little by little
      when it was fair weather. Now I&rsquo;m coming to it. What did We do (in the
      good old times, mind you) when we happened to see that ship in distress?
      Out with our boat; blow high or blow low, out with our boat. And saved the
      lives of the crew, did you say? Well, yes; saving the crew was part of the
      day&rsquo;s work, to be sure; the part we didn&rsquo;t get paid for. We saved <i>the
      cargo,</i> Master! and got salvage!! Hundreds of pounds, I tell you,
      divided amongst us by law!!! Ah, those times are gone. A parcel of sneaks
      get together, and subscribe to build a Steam-Tug. When a ship gets on the
      sands now, out goes the Tug, night and day alike, and brings her safe into
      harbour, and takes the bread out of our mouths. Shameful&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
      I call it&mdash;shameful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last words of the boatman&rsquo;s lament fell lower, lower, lower on Mr.
      Ronald&rsquo;s ears&mdash;he lost them altogether&mdash;he lost the view of the
      sea&mdash;he lost the sense of the wind blowing over him. Suddenly, he was
      roused as if from a deep sleep. On one side, the man from Broadstairs was
      shaking him by the collar. &ldquo;I say, Master, cheer up; what&rsquo;s come to you?&rdquo;
       On the other side, a compassionate lady was offering her smelling-bottle.
      &ldquo;I am afraid, sir, you have fainted.&rdquo; He struggled to his feet, and
      vacantly thanked the lady. The man from Broadstairs&mdash;with an eye to
      salvage&mdash;took charge of the human wreck, and towed him to the nearest
      public-house. &ldquo;A chop and a glass of brandy-and-water,&rdquo; said this good
      Samaritan of the nineteenth century. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you want. I&rsquo;m peckish
      myself, and I&rsquo;ll keep you company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was perfectly passive in the hands of any one who would take charge of
      him; he submitted as if he had been the boatman&rsquo;s dog, and had heard the
      whistle.

    <p>
      It could only be truly said that he had come to himself, when there had
      been time enough for him to feel the reanimating influence of the food and
      drink. Then he got to his feet, and looked with incredulous wonder at the
      companion of his meal. The man from Broadstairs opened his greasy lips,
      and was silenced by the sudden appearance of a gold coin between Mr.
      Ronald&rsquo;s finger and thumb. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me; pay the bill, and bring me
      the change outside.&rdquo; When the boatman joined him, he was reading a letter;
      walking to and fro, and speaking at intervals to himself. &ldquo;God help me,
      have I lost my senses? I don&rsquo;t know what to do next.&rdquo; He referred to the
      letter again: &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t believe me, ask Mrs. Turner, Number 1, Slains
      Row, Ramsgate.&rdquo; He put the letter back in his pocket, and rallied
      suddenly. &ldquo;Slains Row,&rdquo; he said, turning to the boatman. &ldquo;Take me there
      directly, and keep the change for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boatman&rsquo;s gratitude was (apparently) beyond expression in words. He
      slapped his pocket cheerfully, and that was all. Leading the way inland,
      he went downhill, and uphill again&mdash;then turned aside towards the
      eastern extremity of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farnaby, still following, with the woman behind him, stopped when the
      boatman diverged towards the east, and looked up at the name of the
      street. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my instructions,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I know where he&rsquo;s going.
      Step out! We&rsquo;ll get there before him, by another way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ronald and his guide reached a row of poor little houses, with poor
      little gardens in front of them and behind them. The back windows looked
      out on downs and fields lying on either side of the road to Broadstairs.
      It was a lost and lonely spot. The guide stopped, and put a question with
      inquisitive respect. &ldquo;What number, sir?&rdquo; Mr. Ronald had sufficiently
      recovered himself to keep his own counsel. &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      can leave me.&rdquo; The boatman waited a moment. Mr. Ronald looked at him. The
      boatman was slow to understand that his leadership had gone from him.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you don&rsquo;t want me any more?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; Mr.
      Ronald answered. The man from Broadstairs retired&mdash;with his salvage
      to comfort him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number 1 was at the farther extremity of the row of houses. When Mr.
      Ronald rang the bell, the spies were already posted. The woman loitered on
      the road, within view of the door. Farnaby was out of sight, round the
      corner, watching the house over the low wooden palings of the back garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lazy-looking man, in his shirt sleeves, opened the door. &ldquo;Mrs. Turner at
      home?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s at home; but she&rsquo;s too busy to see
      anybody. What&rsquo;s your pleasure?&rdquo; Mr. Ronald declined to accept excuses or
      to answer questions. &ldquo;I must see Mrs. Turner directly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on
      important business.&rdquo; His tone and manner had their effect on the lazy man.
      &ldquo;What name?&rdquo; he asked. Mr. Ronald declined to mention his name. &ldquo;Give my
      message,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t detain Mrs. Turner more than a minute.&rdquo; The
      man hesitated&mdash;and opened the door of the front parlour. An old woman
      was fast asleep on a ragged little sofa. The man gave up the front
      parlour, and tried the back parlour next. It was empty. &ldquo;Please to wait
      here,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and went away to deliver his message.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parlour was a miserably furnished room. Through the open window, the
      patch of back garden was barely visible under fluttering rows of linen
      hanging out on lines to dry. A pack of dirty cards, and some plain
      needlework, littered the bare little table. A cheap American clock ticked
      with stern and steady activity on the mantelpiece. The smell of onions was
      in the air. A torn newspaper, with stains of beer on it, lay on the floor.
      There was some sinister influence in the place which affected Mr. Ronald
      painfully. He felt himself trembling, and sat down on one of the rickety
      chairs. The minutes followed one another wearily. He heard a trampling of
      feet in the room above&mdash;then a door opened and closed&mdash;then the
      rustle of a woman&rsquo;s dress on the stairs. In a moment more, the handle of
      the parlour door was turned. He rose, in anticipation of Mrs. Turner&rsquo;s
      appearance. The door opened. He found himself face to face with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      John Farnaby, posted at the garden paling, suddenly lifted his head and
      looked towards the open window of the back parlour. He reflected for a
      moment&mdash;and then joined his female companion on the road in front of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you at the back garden,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much longer am I to be kept kicking my heels in this wretched hole?&rdquo;
       the woman asked sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much longer as I please&mdash;if you want to go back to London with
      the other half of the money.&rdquo; He showed it to her as he spoke. She
      followed him without another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the paling, Farnaby pointed to the window, and to the back
      garden door, which was left ajar. &ldquo;Speak softly,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Do you
      hear voices in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear what they&rsquo;re talking about, if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear, either. Now mind what I tell you&mdash;I have reasons of my
      own for getting a little nearer to that window. Sit down under the paling,
      so that you can&rsquo;t be seen from the house. If you hear a row, you may take
      it for granted that I am found out. In that case, go back to London by the
      next train, and meet me at the terminus at two o&rsquo;clock tomorrow afternoon.
      If nothing happens, wait where you are till you hear from me or see me
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hand on the low paling, and vaulted over it. The linen hanging
      up in the garden to dry offered him a means of concealment (if any one
      happened to look out of the window) of which he skilfully availed himself.
      The dust-bin was at the side of the house, situated at a right angle to
      the parlour window. He was safe behind the bin, provided no one appeared
      on the path which connected the patch of garden at the back with the patch
      in front. Here, running the risk, he waited and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first voice that reached his ears was the voice of Mrs. Ronald. She
      was speaking with a firmness of tone that astonished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me to the end, Benjamin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have a right to ask as much
      as that of my husband, and I do ask it. If I had been bent on nothing but
      saving the reputation of our miserable girl, you would have a right to
      blame me for keeping you ignorant of the calamity that has fallen on us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There the voice of her husband interposed sternly. &ldquo;Calamity! Say
      disgrace, everlasting disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ronald did not notice the interruption. Sadly and patiently she went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I had a harder trial still to face,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had to save her, in
      spite of herself, from the wretch who has brought this infamy on us. He
      has acted throughout in cold blood; it is his interest to marry her, and
      from first to last he has plotted to force the marriage on us. For God&rsquo;s
      sake, don&rsquo;t speak loud! She is in the room above us; if she hears you it
      will be the death of her. Don&rsquo;t suppose I am talking at random; I have
      looked at his letters to her; I have got the confession of the
      servant-girl. Such a confession! Emma is his victim, body and soul. I know
      it! I know that she sent him money (<i>my</i> money) from this place. I
      know that the servant (at <i>her</i> instigation) informed him by
      telegraph of the birth of the child. Oh, Benjamin, don&rsquo;t curse the poor
      helpless infant&mdash;such a sweet little girl! don&rsquo;t think of it! I don&rsquo;t
      think of it! Show me the letter that brought you here; I want to see the
      letter. Ah, I can tell you who wrote it! <i>He</i> wrote it. In his own
      interests; always with his own interests in view. Don&rsquo;t you see it for
      yourself? If I succeed in keeping this shame and misery a secret from
      everybody&mdash;if I take Emma away, to some place abroad, on pretence of
      her health&mdash;there is an end of his hope of becoming your son-in-law;
      there is an end of his being taken into the business. Yes! he, the
      low-lived vagabond who puts up the shop-shutters, <i>he</i> looks forward
      to being taken into partnership, and succeeding you when you die! Isn&rsquo;t
      his object in writing that letter as plain to you now as the heaven above
      us? His one chance is to set your temper in a flame, to provoke the
      scandal of a discovery&mdash;and to force the marriage on us as the only
      remedy left. Am I wrong in making any sacrifice, rather than bind our girl
      for life, our own flesh and blood, to such a man as that? Surely you can
      feel for me, and forgive me, now. How could I own the truth to you, before
      I left London, knowing you as I do? How could I expect you to be patient,
      to go into hiding, to pass under a false name&mdash;to do all the
      degrading things that must be done, if we are to keep Emma out of this
      man&rsquo;s way? No! I know no more than you do where Farnaby is to be found.
      Hush! there is the door-bell. It&rsquo;s the doctor&rsquo;s time for his visit. I tell
      you again I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;on my sacred word of honour, I don&rsquo;t know
      where Farnaby is. Oh, be quiet! be quiet! there&rsquo;s the doctor going
      upstairs! don&rsquo;t let the doctor hear you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far, she had succeeded in composing her husband. But the fury which she
      had innocently roused in him, in her eagerness to justify herself, now
      broke beyond all control. &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; he cried furiously. &ldquo;If you know
      everything else about it, you know where Farnaby is. I&rsquo;ll be the death of
      him, if I swing for it on the gallows! Where is he? Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shriek from the upper room silenced him before Mrs. Ronald could speak
      again. His daughter had heard him; his daughter had recognized his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry of terror from her mother echoed the cry from above; the sound of
      the opening and closing of the door followed instantly. Then there was a
      momentary silence. Then Mrs. Ronald&rsquo;s voice was heard from the upper room
      calling to the nurse, asleep in the front parlour. The nurse&rsquo;s gruff tones
      were just audible, answering from the parlour door. There was another
      interval of silence; broken by another voice&mdash;a stranger&rsquo;s voice&mdash;speaking
      at the open window, close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me upstairs, sir, directly,&rdquo; the voice said in peremptory tones.
      &ldquo;As your daughter&rsquo;s medical attendant, I tell you in the plainest terms
      that you have seriously frightened her. In her critical condition, I
      decline to answer for her life, unless you make the attempt at least to
      undo the mischief you have done. Whether you mean it or not, soothe her
      with kind words; say you have forgiven her. No! I have nothing to do with
      your domestic troubles; I have only my patient to think of. I don&rsquo;t care
      what she asks of you, you must give way to her now. If she falls into
      convulsions, she will die&mdash;and her death will be at your door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, with feebler and feebler interruptions from Mr. Ronald, the doctor
      spoke. It ended plainly in his being obeyed. The departing footsteps of
      the men were the next sounds to be heard. After that, there was a pause of
      silence&mdash;a long pause, broken by Mrs. Ronald, calling again from the
      upper regions. &ldquo;Take the child into the back parlour, nurse, and wait till
      I come to you. It&rsquo;s cooler there, at this time of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wailing of an infant, and the gruff complaining of the nurse, were the
      next sounds that reached Farnaby in his hiding place. The nurse was
      grumbling to herself over the grievance of having been awakened from her
      sleep. &ldquo;After being up all night, a person wants rest. There&rsquo;s no rest for
      anybody in this house. My head&rsquo;s as heavy as lead, and every bone in me
      has got an ache in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before long, the renewed silence indicated that she had succeeded in
      hushing the child to sleep. Farnaby forgot the restraints of caution for
      the first time. His face flushed with excitement; he ventured nearer to
      the window, in his eagerness to find out what might happen next. After no
      long interval, the next sound came&mdash;a sound of heavy breathing, which
      told him that the drowsy nurse was falling asleep again. The window-sill
      was within reach of his hands. He waited until the heavy breathing
      deepened to snoring. Then he drew himself up by the window-sill, and
      looked into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse was fast asleep in an armchair; and the child was fast asleep on
      her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped softly to the ground again. Taking off his shoes, and putting
      them in his pockets, he ascended the two or three steps which led to the
      half-open back garden door. Arrived in the passage, he could just hear
      them talking upstairs. They were no doubt still absorbed in their
      troubles; he had only the servant to dread. The splashing of water in the
      kitchen informed him that she was safely occupied in washing. Slowly and
      softly he opened the back parlour door, and stole across the room to the
      nurse&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of her hands still rested on the child. The serious risk was the risk
      of waking her, if he lost his presence of mind and hurried it!
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the American clock on the mantelpiece. The result relieved
      him; it was not so late as he had feared. He knelt down, to steady
      himself, as nearly as possible on a level with the nurse&rsquo;s knees. By a
      hair&rsquo;s breadth at a time, he got both hands under the child. By a hair&rsquo;s
      breadth at a time, he drew the child away from her; leaving her hand
      resting on her lap by degrees so gradual that the lightest sleeper could
      not have felt the change. That done (barring accidents), all was done.
      Keeping the child resting easily on his left arm, he had his right hand
      free to shut the door again. Arrived at the garden steps, a slight change
      passed over the sleeping infant&rsquo;s face&mdash;the delicate little creature
      shivered as it felt the full flow of the open air. He softly laid over its
      face a corner of the woollen shawl in which it was wrapped. The child
      reposed as quietly on his arm as if it had still been on the nurse&rsquo;s lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a minute more he was at the paling. The woman rose to receive him, with
      the first smile that had crossed her face since they had left London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got the baby,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a deep one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; he answered irritably. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a moment to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only stopping to put on his shoes, he led the way towards the more central
      part of the town. The first person he met directed him to the railway
      station. It was close by. In five minutes more the woman and the baby were
      safe in the train to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the other half of the money,&rdquo; he said, handing it to her through
      the carriage window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman eyed the child in her arms with a frowning expression of doubt.
      &ldquo;All very well as long as it lasts,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And what after that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I shall call and see you,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked hard at him, and expressed the whole value she set on that
      assurance in four words. &ldquo;Of course you will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The train started for London. Farnaby watched it, as it left the platform,
      with a look of unfeigned relief. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;Emma&rsquo;s
      reputation is safe enough now! When we are married, we mustn&rsquo;t have a
      love-child in the way of our prospects in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the station, he stopped at the refreshment room, and drank a glass
      of brandy-and-water. &ldquo;Something to screw me up,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;for what is
      to come.&rdquo; What was to come (after he had got rid of the child) had been
      carefully considered by him, on the journey to Ramsgate. &ldquo;Emma&rsquo;s
      husband-that-is-to-be&rdquo;&mdash;he had reasoned it out&mdash;&ldquo;will naturally
      be the first person Emma wants to see, when the loss of the baby has upset
      the house. If Old Ronald has a grain of affection left in him, he must let
      her marry me after <i>that!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting on this view of his position, he took the way that led back to
      Slains Row, and rang the door-bell as became a visitor who had no reasons
      for concealment now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The household was doubtless already disorganized by the discovery of the
      child&rsquo;s disappearance. Neither master nor servant was active in answering
      the bell. Farnaby submitted to be kept waiting with perfect composure.
      There are occasions on which a handsome man is bound to put his personal
      advantages to their best use. He took out his pocket-comb, and touched up
      the arrangement of his whiskers with a skilled and gentle hand.
      Approaching footsteps made themselves heard along the passage at last.
      Farnaby put back his comb, and buttoned his coat briskly. &ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; he
      said, as the door was opened at last.

      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sixteen years after the date of Mr. Ronald&rsquo;s disastrous discovery at
      Ramsgate&mdash;that is to say, in the year 1872&mdash;the steamship <i>Aquila</i>
      left the port of New York, bound for Liverpool.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the month of September. The passenger-list of the <i>Aquila</i> had
      comparatively few names inscribed on it. In the autumn season, the voyage
      from America to England, but for the remunerative value of the cargo,
      would prove to be for the most part a profitless voyage to shipowners. The
      flow of passengers, at that time of year, sets steadily the other way.
      Americans are returning from Europe to their own country. Tourists have
      delayed the voyage until the fierce August heat of the United States has
      subsided, and the delicious Indian summer is ready to welcome them. At bed
      and board the passengers by the <i>Aquila</i> on her homeward voyage had
      plenty of room, and the choicest morsels for everybody alike on the well
      spread dinner-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was favourable, the weather was lovely. Cheerfulness and
      good-humour pervaded the ship from stem to stern. The courteous captain
      did the honours of the cabin-table with the air of a gentleman who was
      receiving friends in his own house. The handsome doctor promenaded the
      deck arm-in-arm with ladies in course of rapid recovery from the first
      gastric consequences of travelling by sea. The excellent chief engineer,
      musical in his leisure moments to his fingers&rsquo; ends, played the fiddle in
      his cabin, accompanied on the flute by that young Apollo of the Atlantic
      trade, the steward&rsquo;s mate. Only on the third morning of the voyage was the
      harmony on board the <i>Aquila</i> disturbed by a passing moment of
      discord&mdash;due to an unexpected addition to the ranks of the
      passengers, in the shape of a lost bird!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was merely a weary little land-bird (blown out of its course, as the
      learned in such matters supposed); and it perched on one of the yards to
      rest and recover itself after its long flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant the creature was discovered, the insatiable Anglo-Saxon
      delight in killing birds, from the majestic eagle to the contemptible
      sparrow, displayed itself in its full frenzy. The crew ran about the
      decks, the passengers rushed into their cabins, eager to seize the first
      gun and to have the first shot. An old quarter-master of the <i>Aquila</i>
      was the enviable man, who first found the means of destruction ready to
      his hand. He lifted the gun to his shoulder, he had his finger on the
      trigger, when he was suddenly pounced upon by one of the passengers&mdash;a
      young, slim, sunburnt, active man&mdash;who snatched away the gun,
      discharged it over the side of the vessel, and turned furiously on the
      quarter-master. &ldquo;You wretch! would you kill the poor weary bird that
      trusts our hospitality, and only asks us to give it a rest? That little
      harmless thing is as much one of God&rsquo;s creatures as you are. I&rsquo;m ashamed
      of you&mdash;I&rsquo;m horrified at you&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got bird-murder in your
      face; I hate the sight of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quarter-master&mdash;a large grave fat man, slow alike in his bodily
      and his mental movements&mdash;listened to this extraordinary remonstrance
      with a fixed stare of amazement, and an open mouth from which the unspat
      tobacco-juice tricked in little brown streams. When the impetuous young
      gentleman paused (not for want of words, merely for want of breath), the
      quarter-master turned about, and addressed himself to the audience
      gathered round. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, with a Roman brevity, &ldquo;this young
      fellow is mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s voice checked the general outbreak of laughter. &ldquo;That will
      do, quarter-master. Let it be understood that nobody is to shoot the bird&mdash;and
      let me suggest to <i>you,</i> sir, that you might have expressed your
      sentiments quite as effectually in less violent language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Addressed in those terms, the impetuous young man burst into another fit
      of excitement. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right, sir! I deserve every word you have
      said to me; I feel I have disgraced myself.&rdquo; He ran after the
      quartermaster, and seized him by both hands. &ldquo;I beg your pardon; I beg
      your pardon with all my heart. You would have served me right if you had
      thrown me overboard after the language I used to you. Pray excuse my quick
      temper; pray forgive me. What do you say? &lsquo;Let bygones <i>be</i> bygones&rsquo;?
      That&rsquo;s a capital way of putting it. You&rsquo;re a thorough good fellow. If I
      can ever be of the smallest use to you (there&rsquo;s my card and address in
      London), let me know it; I entreat you let me know it.&rdquo; He returned in a
      violent hurry to the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made it up with the quarter-master,
      sir. He forgives me; he bears no malice. Allow me to congratulate you on
      having such a good Christian in your ship. I wish I was like him! Excuse
      me, ladies and gentlemen, for the disturbance I have made. It shan&rsquo;t
      happen again&mdash;I promise you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The male travellers in general looked at each other, and seemed to agree
      with the quarter-master&rsquo;s opinion of their fellow-passenger. The women,
      touched by his evident sincerity, and charmed with his handsome blushing
      eager face, agreed that he was quite right to save the poor bird, and that
      it would be all the better for the weaker part of creation generally if
      other men were more like him. While the various opinions were still in
      course of expression, the sound of the luncheon bell cleared the deck of
      the passengers, with two exceptions. One was the impetuous young man. The
      other was a middle-aged traveller, with a grizzled beard and a penetrating
      eye, who had silently observed the proceedings, and who now took the
      opportunity of introducing himself to the hero of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not going to take any luncheon?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Among the people I have lived with we don&rsquo;t eat at intervals of
      three or four hours, all day long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you excuse me,&rdquo; pursued the other, &ldquo;if I own I should like to know
      <i>what</i> people you have been living with? My name is Hethcote; I was
      associated, at one time of my life, with a college devoted to the training
      of young men. From what I have seen and heard this morning, I fancy you
      have not been educated on any of the recognized systems that are popular
      at the present day. Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The excitable young man suddenly became the picture of resignation, and
      answered in a formula of words as if he was repeating a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Claude-Amelius-Goldenheart. Aged twenty-one. Son, and only child, of
      the late Claude Goldenheart, of Shedfield Heath, Buckinghamshire, England.
      I have been brought up by the Primitive Christian Socialists, at Tadmor
      Community, State of Illinois. I have inherited an income of five hundred a
      year. And I am now, with the approval of the Community, going to London to
      see life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote received this copious flow of information, in some doubt
      whether he had been made the victim of coarse raillery, or whether he had
      merely heard a quaint statement of facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claude-Amelius-Goldenheart saw that he had produced an unfavourable
      impression, and hastened to set himself right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not making game of you, as you seem to
      suppose. We are taught to be courteous to everybody, in our Community. The
      truth is, there seems to be something odd about me (I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know
      what), which makes people whom I meet on my travels curious to know who I
      am. If you&rsquo;ll please to remember, it&rsquo;s a long way from Illinois to New
      York, and curious strangers are not scarce on the journey. When one is
      obliged to keep on saying the same thing over and over again, a form saves
      a deal of trouble. I have made a form for myself&mdash;which is
      respectfully at the disposal of any person who does me the honour to wish
      for my acquaintance. Will that do, sir? Very well, then; shake hands, to
      show you&rsquo;re satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote shook hands, more than satisfied. He found it impossible to
      resist the bright honest brown eyes, the simple winning cordial manner of
      the young fellow with the quaint formula and the strange name. &ldquo;Come, Mr.
      Goldenheart,&rdquo; he said, leading the way to a seat on deck, &ldquo;let us sit down
      comfortably, and have a talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you like, sir&mdash;but don&rsquo;t call me Mr. Goldenheart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it sounds formal. And, besides, you&rsquo;re old enough to be my father;
      it&rsquo;s <i>my</i> duty to call <i>you</i> Mister&mdash;or Sir, as we say to
      our elders at Tadmor. I have left all my friends behind me at the
      Community&mdash;and I feel lonely out here on this big ocean, among
      strangers. Do me a kindness, sir. Call me by my Christian name; and give
      me a friendly slap on the back if you find we get along smoothly in the
      course of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of your names shall it be?&rdquo; Mr. Hethcote asked, humouring this odd
      lad. &ldquo;Claude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not Claude. The Primitive Christians said Claude was a finicking
      French name. Call me Amelius, and I shall begin to feel at home again. If
      you&rsquo;re in a hurry, cut it down to three letters (as they did at Tadmor),
      and call me Mel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Mr. Hethcote. &ldquo;Now, my friend Amelius (or Mel), I am
      going to speak out plainly, as you do. The Primitive Christian Socialists
      must have great confidence in their system of education, to turn you
      adrift in the world without a companion to look after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it, sir,&rdquo; Amelius answered coolly. &ldquo;They have unlimited
      confidence in their system of education. And I&rsquo;m a proof of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have relations in London, I suppose?&rdquo; Mr. Hethcote proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time the face of Amelius showed a shadow of sadness on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have relations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I have promised never to claim their
      hospitality. &lsquo;They are hard and worldly; and they will make you hard and
      worldly, too.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what my father said to me on his deathbed.&rdquo; He took
      off his hat when he mentioned his father&rsquo;s death, and came to a sudden
      pause&mdash;with his head bent down, like a man absorbed in thought. In
      less than a minute he put on his hat again, and looked up with his bright
      winning smile. &ldquo;We say a little prayer for the loved ones who are gone,
      when we speak of them,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t say it out loud, for
      fear of seeming to parade our religious convictions. We hate cant in our
      Community.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cordially agree with the Community, Amelius. But, my good fellow, have
      you really no friend to welcome you when you get to London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius answered the question mysteriously. &ldquo;Wait a little!&rdquo; he said&mdash;and
      took a letter from the breast-pocket of his coat. Mr. Hethcote, watching
      him, observed that he looked at the address with unfeigned pride and
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of our brethren at the Community has given me this,&rdquo; he announced.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a letter of introduction, sir, to a remarkable man&mdash;a man who
      is an example to all the rest of us. He has risen, by dint of integrity
      and perseverance, from the position of a poor porter in a shop to be one
      of the most respected mercantile characters in the City of London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this explanation, Amelius handed his letter to Mr. Hethcote. It was
      addressed as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         To John Farnaby, Esquire,
         Messrs. Ronald &amp; Farnaby,
         Stationers,
         Aldersgate Street, London.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote looked at the address on the letter with an expression of
      surprise, which did not escape the notice of Amelius. &ldquo;Do you know Mr.
      Farnaby?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some acquaintance with him,&rdquo; was the answer, given with a certain
      appearance of constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius went on eagerly with his questions. &ldquo;What sort of man is he? Do
      you think he will be prejudiced against me, because I have been brought up
      in Tadmor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be a little better acquainted, Amelius, with you and Tadmor before
      I can answer your question. Suppose you tell me how you became one of the
      Socialists, to begin with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only a little boy, Mr. Hethcote, at that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Even little boys have memories. Is there any objection to your
      telling me what you can remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius answered rather sadly, with his eyes bent on the deck. &ldquo;I remember
      something happening which threw a gloom over us at home in England. I
      heard that my mother was concerned in it. When I grew older, I never
      presumed to ask my father what it was; and he never offered to tell me. I
      only know this: that he forgave her some wrong she had done him, and let
      her go on living at home&mdash;and that relations and friends all blamed
      him, and fell away from him, from that time. Not long afterwards, while I
      was at school, my mother died. I was sent for, to follow her funeral with
      my father. When we got back, and were alone together, he took me on his
      knee and kissed me. &lsquo;Which will you do, Amelius,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;stay in
      England with your uncle and aunt? or come with me all the way to America,
      and never go back to England again? Take time to think of it.&rsquo; I wanted no
      time to think of it; I said, &lsquo;Go with you, papa.&rsquo; He frightened me by
      bursting out crying; it was the first time I had ever seen him in tears. I
      can understand it now. He had been cut to the heart, and had borne it like
      a martyr; and his boy was his one friend left. Well, by the end of the
      week we were on board the ship; and there we met a benevolent gentleman,
      with a long gray beard, who bade my father welcome, and presented me with
      a cake. In my ignorance, I thought he was the captain. Nothing of the
      sort. He was the first Socialist I had ever seen; and it was he who had
      persuaded my father to leave England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote&rsquo;s opinions of Socialists began to show themselves (a little
      sourly) in Mr. Hethcote&rsquo;s smile. &ldquo;And how did you get on with this
      benevolent gentleman?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;After converting your father, did he
      convert you&mdash;with the cake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius smiled. &ldquo;Do him justice, sir; he didn&rsquo;t trust to the cake. He
      waited till we were in sight of the American land&mdash;and then he
      preached me a little sermon, on our arrival, entirely for my own use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sermon?&rdquo; Mr. Hethcote repeated. &ldquo;Very little religion in it, I
      suspect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little indeed, sir,&rdquo; Amelius answered. &ldquo;Only as much religion as
      there is in the New Testament. I was not quite old enough to understand
      him easily&mdash;so he wrote down his discourse on the fly-leaf of a
      story-book I had with me, and gave it to me to read when I was tired of
      the stories. Stories were scarce with me in those days; and, when I had
      exhausted my little stock, rather than read nothing I read my sermon&mdash;read
      it so often that I think I can remember every word of it now. &lsquo;My dear
      little boy, the Christian religion, as Christ taught it, has long ceased
      to be the religion of the Christian world. A selfish and cruel Pretence is
      set up in its place. Your own father is one example of the truth of this
      saying of mine. He has fulfilled the first and foremost duty of a true
      Christian&mdash;the duty of forgiving an injury. For this, he stands
      disgraced in the estimation of all his friends: they have renounced and
      abandoned him. He forgives them, and seeks peace and good company in the
      New World, among Christians like himself. You will not repent leaving home
      with him; you will be one of a loving family, and, when you are old
      enough, you will be free to decide for yourself what your future life
      shall be.&rsquo; That was all I knew about the Socialists, when we reached
      Tadmor after our long journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote&rsquo;s prejudices made their appearance again. &ldquo;A barren sort of
      place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;judging by the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barren? What can you be thinking of? A prettier place I never saw, and
      never expect to see again. A clear winding river, running into a little
      blue lake. A broad hill-side, all laid out in flower-gardens, and shaded
      by splendid trees. On the top of the hill, the buildings of the Community,
      some of brick and some of wood, so covered with creepers and so encircled
      with verandahs that I can&rsquo;t tell you to this day what style of
      architecture they were built in. More trees behind the houses&mdash;and,
      on the other side of the hill, cornfields, nothing but cornfields rolling
      away and away in great yellow plains, till they reached the golden sky and
      the setting sun, and were seen no more. That was our first view of Tadmor,
      when the stage-coach dropped us at the town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote still held out. &ldquo;And what about the people who live in this
      earthly Paradise?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Male and female saints&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no, sir! The very opposite of saints. They eat and drink like
      their neighbours. They never think of wearing dirty horsehair when they
      can get clean linen. And when they are tempted to misconduct themselves,
      they find a better way out of it than knotting a cord and thrashing their
      own backs. Saints! They all ran out together to bid us welcome like a lot
      of school-children; the first thing they did was to kiss us, and the next
      thing was to give us a mug of wine of their own making. Saints! Oh, Mr.
      Hethcote, what will you accuse us of being next? I declare your suspicions
      of the poor Socialists keep cropping up again as fast as I cut them down.
      May I make a guess, sir, without offending you? From one or two things I
      have noticed, I strongly suspect you&rsquo;re a British clergyman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote was conquered at last: he burst out laughing. &ldquo;You have
      discovered me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;travelling in a coloured cravat and a shooting
      jacket! I confess I should like to know how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easily explained, sir. Visitors of all sorts are welcome at Tadmor.
      We have a large experience of them in the travelling season. They all come
      with their own private suspicion of us lurking about the corners of their
      eyes. They see everything we have to show them, and eat and drink at our
      table, and join in our amusements, and get as pleasant and friendly with
      us as can be. The time comes to say goodbye&mdash;and then we find them
      out. If a guest who has been laughing and enjoying himself all day,
      suddenly becomes serious when he takes his leave, and shows that little
      lurking devil of suspicion again about the corners of his eyes&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      ten chances to one that he&rsquo;s a clergyman. No offence, Mr. Hethcote! I
      acknowledge with pleasure that the corners of <i>your</i> eyes are clear
      again. You&rsquo;re not a very clerical clergyman, sir, after all&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      despair of converting you, yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with your story, Amelius. You&rsquo;re the queerest fellow I have met
      with, for many a long day past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little doubtful about going on with my story, sir. I have told you
      how I got to Tadmor, and what it looks like, and what sort of people live
      in the place. If I am to get on beyond that, I must jump to the time when
      I was old enough to learn the Rules of the Community.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;and what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Hethcote, some of the Rules might offend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir! don&rsquo;t blame me; <i>I&rsquo;m</i> not ashamed of the Rules. And
      now, if I am to speak, I must speak seriously on a serious subject; I must
      begin with our religious principles. We find our Christianity in the
      spirit of the New Testament&mdash;not in the letter. We have three good
      reasons for objecting to pin our faith on the words alone, in that book.
      First, because we are not sure that the English translation is always to
      be depended on as accurate and honest. Secondly, because we know that
      (since the invention of printing) there is not a copy of the book in
      existence which is free from errors of the press, and that (before the
      invention of printing) those errors, in manuscript copies, must as a
      matter of course have been far more serious and far more numerous.
      Thirdly, because there is plain internal evidence (to say nothing of
      discoveries actually made in the present day) of interpolations and
      corruptions, introduced into the manuscript copies as they succeeded each
      other in ancient times. These drawbacks are of no importance, however, in
      our estimation. We find, in the spirit of the book, the most simple and
      most perfect system of religion and morality that humanity has ever
      received&mdash;and with that we are content. To reverence God; and to love
      our neighbour as ourselves: if we had only those two commandments to guide
      us, we should have enough. The whole collection of Doctrines (as they are
      called) we reject at once, without even stopping to discuss them. We apply
      to them the test suggested by Christ himself: by their fruits ye shall
      know them. The fruits of Doctrines, in the past (to quote three instances
      only), have been the Spanish Inquisition, the Massacre of St. Bartholomew,
      and the Thirty Years&rsquo; War&mdash;and the fruits, in the present, are
      dissension, bigotry, and opposition to useful reforms. Away with
      Doctrines! In the interests of Christianity, away with them! We are to
      love our enemies; we are to forgive injuries; we are to help the needy; we
      are to be pitiful and courteous, slow to judge others, and ashamed to
      exalt ourselves. That teaching doesn&rsquo;t lead to tortures, massacres, and
      wars; to envy, hatred, and malice&mdash;and for that reason it stands
      revealed to us as the teaching that we can trust. There is our religion,
      sir, as we find it in the Rules of the Community.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Amelius. I notice, in passing, that the Community is in one
      respect like the Pope&mdash;the Community is infallible. We won&rsquo;t dwell on
      that. You have stated your principles. As to the application of them next?
      Nobody has a right to be rich among you, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it the other way, Mr. Hethcote. All men have a right to be rich&mdash;provided
      they don&rsquo;t make other people poor, as a part of the process. We don&rsquo;t
      trouble ourselves much about money; that&rsquo;s the truth. We are farmers,
      carpenters, weavers, and printers; and what we earn (ask our neighbours if
      we don&rsquo;t earn it honestly) goes into the common fund. A man who comes to
      us with money puts it into the fund, and so makes things easy for the next
      man who comes with empty pockets. While they are with us, they all live in
      the same comfort, and have their equal share in the same profits&mdash;deducting
      the sum in reverse for sudden calls and bad times. If they leave us, the
      man who has brought money with him has his undisputed right to take it
      away again; and the man who has brought none bids us good-bye, all the
      richer for his equal share in the profits which he has personally earned.
      The only fuss at our place about money that I can remember was the fuss
      about my five hundred a year. I wanted to hand it over to the fund. It was
      my own, mind&mdash;inherited from my mother&rsquo;s property, on my coming of
      age. The Elders wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it: the Council wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it: the
      general vote of the Community wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. &lsquo;We agreed with his
      father that he should decide for himself, when he grew to manhood&rsquo;&mdash;that
      was how they put it. &lsquo;Let him go back to the Old World; and let him be
      free to choose, by the test of his own experience, what his future life
      shall be.&rsquo; How do you think it will end, Mr. Hethcote? Shall I return to
      the Community? Or shall I stop in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote answered, without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;You will stop in
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you two to one, Sir, he goes back to the Community.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In those words, a third voice (speaking in a strong New England accent)
      insinuated itself into the conversation from behind. Amelius and Mr.
      Hethcote, looking round, discovered a long, lean, grave stranger&mdash;with
      his face overshadowed by a huge felt hat. &ldquo;Have you been listening to our
      conversation?&rdquo; Mr. Hethcote asked haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been listening,&rdquo; answered the grave stranger, &ldquo;with considerable
      interest. This young man, I find, opens a new chapter to me in the book of
      humanity. Do you accept my bet, Sir? My name is Rufus Dingwell; and my
      home is at Coolspring, Mass. You do <i>not</i> bet? I express my regret,
      and have the pleasure of taking a seat alongside of you. What is your
      name, Sir? Hethcote? We have one of that name at Coolspring. He is much
      respected. Mr. Claude A. Goldenheart, you are no stranger to me&mdash;no,
      Sir. I procured your name from the steward, when the little difficulty
      occurred just now about the bird. Your name considerably surprised me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Amelius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir&mdash;not to say that your surname (being Goldenheart) reminds
      one unexpectedly of <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>&mdash;I happen to be
      already acquainted with you. By reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked puzzled. &ldquo;By reputation?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means, sir, that you occupy a prominent position in a recent number of
      our popular journal, entitled <i>The Coolspring Democrat.</i> The late
      romantic incident which caused the withdrawal of Miss Mellicent from your
      Community has produced a species of social commotion at Coolspring. Among
      our ladies, the tone of sentiment, Sir, is universally favourable to you.
      When I left, I do assure you, you were a popular character among us. The
      name of Claude A. Goldenheart was, so to speak, in everybody&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius listened to this, with the colour suddenly deepening on his face,
      and with every appearance of heartfelt annoyance and regret. &ldquo;There is no
      such thing as keeping a secret in America,&rdquo; he said, irritably. &ldquo;Some spy
      must have got among us; none of <i>our</i> people would have exposed the
      poor lady to public comment. How would you like it, Mr. Dingwell, if the
      newspaper published the private sorrows of your wife or your daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus Dingwell answered with the straightforward sincerity of feeling
      which is one of the indisputable virtues of his nation. &ldquo;I had not thought
      of it in that light, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have been good enough to credit
      me with a wife or a daughter. I do not possess either of those ladies; but
      your argument hits me, notwithstanding&mdash;hits me hard, I tell you.&rdquo; He
      looked at Mr. Hethcote, who sat silently and stiffly disapproving of all
      this familiarity, and applied himself in perfect innocence and good faith
      to making things pleasant in that quarter. &ldquo;You are a stranger, Sir,&rdquo; said
      Rufus; &ldquo;and you will doubtless wish to peruse the article which is the
      subject of conversation?&rdquo; He took a newspaper slip from his pocket-book,
      and offered it to the astonished Englishman. &ldquo;I shall be glad to hear your
      sentiments, sir, on the view propounded by our mutual friend, Claude A.
      Goldenheart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Mr. Hethcote could reply, Amelius interposed in his own headlong
      way. &ldquo;Give it to me! I want to read it first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snatched at the newspaper slip. Rufus checked him with grave composure.
      &ldquo;I am of a cool temperament myself, sir; but that don&rsquo;t prevent me from
      admiring heat in others. Short of boiling point&mdash;mind that!&rdquo; With
      this hint, the wise New Englander permitted Amelius to take possession of
      the printed slip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote, finding an opportunity of saying a word at last, asserted
      himself a little haughtily. &ldquo;I beg you will both of you understand that I
      decline to read anything which relates to another person&rsquo;s private
      affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither the one nor the other of his companions paid the slightest heed to
      this announcement. Amelius was reading the newspaper extract, and placid
      Rufus was watching him. In another moment, he crumpled up the slip, and
      threw it indignantly on the deck. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as full of lies as it can hold!&rdquo;
       he burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over the United States, by this time,&rdquo; Rufus remarked. &ldquo;And I
      don&rsquo;t doubt we shall find the English papers have copied it, when we get
      to Liverpool. If you will take my advice, sir, you will cultivate a
      sagacious insensibility to the comments of the press.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I care for myself?&rdquo; Amelius asked indignantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
      poor woman I am thinking of. What can I do to clear her character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; suggested Rufus, &ldquo;in your place, I should have a notification
      circulated through the ship, announcing a lecture on the subject (weather
      permitting) in the course of the afternoon. That&rsquo;s the way we should do it
      at Coolspring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius listened without conviction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly useless to make a
      secret of the matter now,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see my way to making it
      more public still.&rdquo; He paused, and looked at Mr. Hethcote. &ldquo;It so happens,
      sir,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;that this unfortunate affair is an example of some of
      the Rules of our Community, which I had not had time to speak of, when Mr.
      Dingwell here joined us. It will be a relief to me to contradict these
      abominable falsehoods to somebody; and I should like (if you don&rsquo;t mind)
      to hear what you think of my conduct, from your own point of view. It
      might prepare me,&rdquo; he added, smiling rather uneasily, &ldquo;for what I may find
      in the English newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words of introduction he told his sad story&mdash;jocosely
      described in the newspaper heading as &ldquo;Miss Mellicent and Goldenheart
      among the Socialists at Tadmor.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly six months since,&rdquo; said Amelius, &ldquo;we had notice by letter of the
      arrival of an unmarried English lady, who wished to become a member of our
      Community. You will understand my motive in keeping her family name a
      secret: even the newspaper has grace enough only to mention her by her
      Christian name. I don&rsquo;t want to cheat you out of your interest; so I will
      own at once that Miss Mellicent was not beautiful, and not young. When she
      came to us, she was thirty-eight years old, and time and trial had set
      their marks on her face plainly enough for anybody to see. Notwithstanding
      this, we all thought her an interesting woman. It might have been the
      sweetness of her voice; or perhaps it was something in her expression that
      took our fancy. There! I can&rsquo;t explain it; I can only say there were young
      women and pretty women at Tadmor who failed to win us as Miss Mellicent
      did. Contradictory enough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote said he understood the contradiction. Rufus put an
      appropriate question: &ldquo;Do you possess a photograph of this lady, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Amelius; &ldquo;I wish I did. Well, we received her, on her arrival,
      in the Common Room&mdash;called so because we all assemble there every
      evening, when the work of the day is done. Sometimes we have the reading
      of a poem or a novel; sometimes debates on the social and political
      questions of the time in England and America; sometimes music, or dancing,
      or cards, or billiards, to amuse us. When a new member arrives, we have
      the ceremonies of introduction. I was close by the Elder Brother (that&rsquo;s
      the name we give to the chief of the Community) when two of the women led
      Miss Mellicent in. He&rsquo;s a hearty old fellow, who lived the first part of
      his life on his own clearing in one of the Western forests. To this day,
      he can&rsquo;t talk long, without showing, in one way or another, that his old
      familiarity with the trees still keeps its place in his memory. He looked
      hard at Miss Mellicent, under his shaggy old white eyebrows; and I heard
      him whisper to himself, &lsquo;Ah, dear me! Another of The Fallen Leaves!&rsquo; I
      knew what he meant. The people who have drawn blanks in the lottery of
      life&mdash;the people who have toiled hard after happiness, and have
      gathered nothing but disappointment and sorrow; the friendless and the
      lonely, the wounded and the lost&mdash;these are the people whom our good
      Elder Brother calls The Fallen Leaves. I like the saying myself; it&rsquo;s a
      tender way of speaking of our poor fellow-creatures who are down in the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment, looking out thoughtfully over the vast void of sea
      and sky. A passing shadow of sadness clouded his bright young face. The
      two elder men looked at him in silence, feeling (in widely different ways)
      the same compassionate interest. What was the life that lay before him?
      And&mdash;God help him!&mdash;what would he do with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did I leave off?&rdquo; he asked, rousing himself suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You left Miss Mellicent, sir, in the Common Room&mdash;the venerable
      citizen with the white eyebrows being suitably engaged in moralizing on
      her.&rdquo; In those terms the ever-ready Rufus set the story going again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; Amelius resumed. &ldquo;There she was, poor thing, a little thin
      timid creature, in a white dress, with a black scarf over her shoulders,
      trembling and wondering in a room full of strangers. The Elder Brother
      took her by the hand, and kissed her on the forehead, and bade her
      heartily welcome in the name of the Community. Then the women followed his
      example, and the men all shook hands with her. And then our chief put the
      three questions, which he is bound to address to all new arrivals when
      they join us: &lsquo;Do you come here of your own free will? Do you bring with
      you a written recommendation from one of our brethren, which satisfies us
      that we do no wrong to ourselves or to others in receiving you? Do you
      understand that you are not bound to us by vows, and that you are free to
      leave us again if the life here is not agreeable to you?&rsquo; Matters being
      settled so far, the reading of the Rules, and the Penalties imposed for
      breaking them, came next. Some of the Rules you know already; others of
      smaller importance I needn&rsquo;t trouble you with. As for the Penalties, if
      you incur the lighter ones, you are subject to public rebuke, or to
      isolation for a time from the social life of the Community. If you incur
      the heavier ones, you are either sent out into the world again for a given
      period, to return or not as you please; or you are struck off the list of
      members, and expelled for good and all. Suppose these preliminaries agreed
      to by Miss Mellicent with silent submission, and let us go on to the close
      of the ceremony&mdash;the reading of the Rules which settle the questions
      of Love and Marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Mr. Hethcote, &ldquo;we are coming to the difficulties of the
      Community at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we also coming to Miss Mellicent, sir?&rdquo; Rufus inquired. &ldquo;As a citizen
      of a free country in which I can love in one State, marry in another, and
      be divorced in a third, I am not interested in your Rules&mdash;I am
      interested in your Lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two are inseparable in this case,&rdquo; Amelius answered gravely. &ldquo;If I am
      to speak of Miss Mellicent, I must speak of the Rules; you will soon see
      why. Our Community becomes a despotism, gentlemen, in dealing with love
      and marriage. For example, it positively prohibits any member afflicted
      with hereditary disease from marrying at all; and it reserves to itself,
      in the case of every proposed marriage among us, the right of permitting
      or forbidding it, in council. We can&rsquo;t even fall in love with each other,
      without being bound, under penalties, to report it to the Elder Brother;
      who, in his turn, communicates it to the monthly council; who, in their
      turn, decide whether the courtship may go on or not. That&rsquo;s not the worst
      of it, even yet! In some cases&mdash;where we haven&rsquo;t the slightest
      intention of falling in love with each other&mdash;the governing body
      takes the initiative. &lsquo;You two will do well to marry; we see it, if you
      don&rsquo;t. Just think of it, will you?&rsquo; You may laugh; some of our happiest
      marriages have been made in that way. Our governors in council act on an
      established principle: here it is in a nutshell. The results of experience
      in the matter of marriage, all over the world, show that a really wise
      choice of a husband or a wife is an exception to the rule; and that
      husbands and wives in general would be happier together if their marriages
      were managed for them by competent advisers on either side. Laws laid down
      on such lines as these, and others equally strict, which I have not
      mentioned yet, were not put in force, Mr. Hethcote, as you suppose,
      without serious difficulties&mdash;difficulties which threatened the very
      existence of the Community. But that was before my time. When I grew up, I
      found the husbands and wives about me content to acknowledge that the
      Rules fulfilled the purpose with which they had been made&mdash;the
      greatest happiness of the greatest number. It all looks very absurd, I
      dare say, from your point of view. But these queer regulations of ours
      answer the Christian test&mdash;by their fruits ye shall know them. Our
      married people don&rsquo;t live on separate sides of the house; our children are
      all healthy; wife-beating is unknown among us; and the practice in our
      divorce court wouldn&rsquo;t keep the most moderate lawyer on bread and cheese.
      Can you say as much for the success of the marriage laws in Europe? I
      leave you, gentlemen, to form your own opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote declined to express an opinion. Rufus declined to resign his
      interest in the lady. &ldquo;And what did Miss Mellicent say to it?&rdquo; he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said something that startled us all,&rdquo; Amelius replied. &ldquo;When the
      Elder Brother began to read the first words relating to love and marriage
      in the Book of Rules, she turned deadly pale; and rose up in her place
      with a sudden burst of courage or desperation&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know which.
      &lsquo;Must you read that to me?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;I have nothing to do with love or
      marriage.&rsquo; The Elder Brother laid aside his Book of Rules. &lsquo;If you are
      afflicted with an hereditary malady,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the doctor from the town
      will examine you, and report to us.&rsquo; She answered, &lsquo;I have no hereditary
      malady.&rsquo; The Elder Brother took up his book again. &lsquo;In due course of time,
      my dear, the Council will decide for you whether you are to love and marry
      or not.&rsquo; And he read the Rules. She sat down again, and hid her face in
      her hands, and never moved or spoke until he had done. The regular
      questions followed. Had she anything to say, in the way of objection?
      Nothing! In that case, would she sign the Rules? Yes! When the time came
      for supper, she excused herself, just like a child. &lsquo;I feel very tired;
      may I go to bed?&rsquo; The unmarried women in the same dormitory with her
      anticipated some romantic confession when she grew used to her new
      friends. They proved to be wrong. &lsquo;My life has been one long
      disappointment,&rsquo; was all she said. &lsquo;You will do me a kindness if you will
      take me as I am, and not ask me to talk about myself.&rsquo; There was nothing
      sulky or ungracious in the expression of her wish to keep her own secret.
      A kinder and sweeter woman&mdash;never thinking of herself, always
      considerate of others&mdash;never lived. An accidental discovery made me
      her chief friend, among the men: it turned out that her childhood had been
      passed, where my childhood had been passed, at Shedfield Heath, in
      Buckinghamshire. She was never weary of consulting my boyish
      recollections, and comparing them with her own. &lsquo;I love the place,&rsquo; she
      used to say; &lsquo;the only happy time of my life was the time passed there.&rsquo; 
      On my sacred word of honour, this was the sort of talk that passed between
      us, for week after week. What other talk could pass between a man whose
      one and twentieth birthday was then near at hand, and a woman who was
      close on forty? What could I do, when the poor, broken, disappointed
      creature met me on the hill or by the river, and said, &lsquo;You are going out
      for a walk; may I come with you?&rsquo; I never attempted to intrude myself into
      her confidence; I never even asked her why she had joined the Community.
      You see what is coming, don&rsquo;t you? <i>I</i> never saw it. I didn&rsquo;t know
      what it meant, when some of the younger women, meeting us together, looked
      at me (not at her), and smiled maliciously. My stupid eyes were opened at
      last by the woman who slept in the next bed to her in the dormitory&mdash;a
      woman old enough to be my mother, who took care of me when I was a child
      at Tadmor. She stopped me one morning, on my way to fish in the river.
      &lsquo;Amelius,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t go to the fishing-house; Mellicent is waiting
      for you.&rsquo; I stared at her in astonishment. She held up her finger at me:
      &lsquo;Take care, you foolish boy! You are drifting into a false position as
      fast as you can. Have you no suspicion of what is going on?&rsquo; I looked all
      round me, in search of what was going on. Nothing out of the common was to
      be seen anywhere. &lsquo;What can you possibly mean?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;You will only
      laugh at me, if I tell you,&rsquo; she said. I promised not to laugh. She too
      looked all round her, as if she was afraid of somebody being near enough
      to hear us; and then she let out the secret. &lsquo;Amelius, ask for a holiday&mdash;and
      leave us for a while. Mellicent is in love with you.&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      Amelius looked at his companions, in some doubt whether they would
      preserve their gravity at this critical point in his story. They both
      showed him that his apprehensions were well founded. He was a little hurt,
      and he instantly revealed it. &ldquo;I own to my shame that I burst out laughing
      myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But you two gentlemen are older and wiser than I am. I
      didn&rsquo;t expect to find you just as ready to laugh at poor Miss Mellicent as
      I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote declined to be reminded of his duties as a middle-aged
      gentleman in this backhanded manner. &ldquo;Gently, Amelius! You can&rsquo;t expect to
      persuade us that a laughable thing is not a thing to be laughed at. A
      woman close on forty who falls in love with a young fellow of twenty-one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is a laughable circumstance,&rdquo; Rufus interposed. &ldquo;Whereas a man of forty
      who fancies a young woman of twenty-one is all in the order of Nature. The
      men have settled it so. But why the women are to give up so much sooner
      than the men is a question, sir, on which I have long wished to hear the
      sentiments of the women themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote dismissed the sentiments of the women with a wave of his
      hand. &ldquo;Let us hear the rest of it, Amelius. Of course you went on to the
      fishing-house? And of course you found Miss Mellicent there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came to the door to meet me, much as usual,&rdquo; Amelius resumed, &ldquo;and
      suddenly checked herself in the act of shaking hands with me. I can only
      suppose she saw something in my face that startled her. How it happened, I
      can&rsquo;t say; but I felt my good spirits forsake me the moment I found myself
      in her presence. I doubt if she had ever seen me so serious before. &lsquo;Have
      I offended you?&rsquo; she asked. Of course, I denied it; but I failed to
      satisfy her. She began to tremble. &lsquo;Has somebody said something against
      me? Are you weary of my company?&rsquo; Those were the next questions. It was
      useless to say No. Some perverse distrust of me, or some despair of
      herself, overpowered her on a sudden. She sank down on the floor of the
      fishing-house, and began to cry&mdash;not a good hearty burst of tears; a
      silent, miserable, resigned sort of crying, as if she had lost all claim
      to be pitied, and all right to feel wounded or hurt. I was so distressed,
      that I thought of nothing but consoling her. I meant well, and I acted
      like a fool. A sensible man would have lifted her up, I suppose, and left
      her to herself. I lifted her up, and put my arm round her waist. She
      looked at me as I did it. For just a moment, I declare she became twenty
      years younger! She blushed as I have never seen a woman blush before or
      since&mdash;the colour flowed all over her neck as well as her face.
      Before I could say a word, she caught hold of my hand, and (of all the
      confusing things in the world!) kissed it. &lsquo;No!&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t despise
      me! don&rsquo;t laugh at me! Wait, and hear what my life has been, and then you
      will understand why a little kindness overpowers me.&rsquo; She looked round the
      corner of the fishing-house suspiciously. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want anybody else to
      hear us,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;all the pride isn&rsquo;t beaten out of me yet. Come to the
      lake, and row me about in the boat.&rsquo; I took her out in the boat. Nobody
      could hear us certainly; but she forgot, and I forgot, that anybody might
      see us, and that appearances on the lake might lead to false conclusions
      on shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote and Rufus exchanged significant looks. They had not forgotten
      the Rules of the Community, when two of its members showed a preference
      for each other&rsquo;s society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius proceeded. &ldquo;Well, there we were on the lake. I paddled with the
      oars, and she opened her whole heart to me. Her troubles had begun, in a
      very common way, with her mother&rsquo;s death and her father&rsquo;s second marriage.
      She had a brother and a sister&mdash;the sister married a German merchant,
      settled in New York; the brother comfortably established as a sheep-farmer
      in Australia. So, you see, she was alone at home, at the mercy of the
      step-mother. I don&rsquo;t understand these cases myself, but people who do,
      tell me that there are generally faults on both sides. To make matters
      worse, they were a poor family; the one rich relative being a sister of
      the first wife, who disapproved of the widower marrying again, and never
      entered the house afterwards. Well, the step-mother had a sharp tongue,
      and Mellicent was the first person to feel the sting of it. She was
      reproached with being an encumbrance on her father, when she ought to be
      doing something for herself. There was no need to repeat those harsh
      words. The next day she answered an advertisement. Before the week was
      over, she was earning her bread as a daily governess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Rufus stopped the narrative, having an interesting question to put.
      &ldquo;Might I inquire, sir, what her salary was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty pounds a year,&rdquo; Amelius replied. &ldquo;She was out teaching from nine
      o&rsquo;clock to two&mdash;and then went home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems to be nothing to complain of in that, as salaries go,&rdquo; Mr.
      Hethcote remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She made no complaint,&rdquo; Amelius rejoined. &ldquo;She was satisfied with her
      salary; but she wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with her life. The meek little woman grew
      downright angry when she spoke of it. &lsquo;I had no reason to complain of my
      employers,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I was civilly treated and punctually paid; but I
      never made friends of them. I tried to make friends of the children; and
      sometimes I thought I had succeeded&mdash;but, oh dear, when they were
      idle, and I was obliged to keep them to their lessons, I soon found how
      little hold I had on the love that I wanted them to give me. We see
      children in books who are perfect little angels; never envious or greedy
      or sulky or deceitful; always the same sweet, pious, tender, grateful,
      innocent creatures&mdash;and it has been my misfortune never to meet with
      them, go where I might! It is a hard world, Amelius, the world that I have
      lived in. I don&rsquo;t think there are such miserable lives anywhere as the
      lives led by the poor middle classes in England. From year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s
      end, the one dreadful struggle to keep up appearances, and the
      heart-breaking monotony of an existence without change. We lived in the
      back street of a cheap suburb. I declare to you we had but one amusement
      in the whole long weary year&mdash;the annual concert the clergyman got
      up, in aid of his schools. The rest of the year it was all teaching for
      the first half of the day, and needlework for the young family for the
      other half. My father had religious scruples; he prohibited theatres, he
      prohibited dancing and light reading; he even prohibited looking in at the
      shop-windows, because we had no money to spare and they tempted us to buy.
      He went to business in the morning, and came back at night, and fell
      asleep after dinner, and woke up and read prayers&mdash;and next day to
      business and back, and sleeping and waking and reading prayers&mdash;and
      no break in it, week after week, month after month, except on Sunday,
      which was always the same Sunday; the same church, the same service, the
      same dinner, the same book of sermons in the evening. Even when we had a
      fortnight once a year at the seaside, we always went to the same place and
      lodged in the same cheap house. The few friends we had led just the same
      lives, and were beaten down flat by just the same monotony. All the women
      seemed to submit to it contentedly except my miserable self. I wanted so
      little! Only a change now and then; only a little sympathy when I was
      weary and sick at heart; only somebody whom I could love and serve, and be
      rewarded with a smile and a kind word in return. Mothers shook their
      heads, and daughters laughed at me. Have we time to be sentimental?
      Haven&rsquo;t we enough to do, darning and mending, and turning our dresses, and
      making the joint last as long as possible, and keeping the children clean,
      and doing the washing at home&mdash;and tea and sugar rising, and my
      husband grumbling every week when I have to ask him for the house-money.
      Oh, no more of it! no more of it! People meant for better things all
      ground down to the same sordid and selfish level&mdash;is that a pleasant
      sight to contemplate? I shudder when I think of the last twenty years of
      my life!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what she complained of, Mr. Hethcote, in the solitary
      middle of the lake, with nobody but me to hear her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my country, sir,&rdquo; Rufus remarked, &ldquo;the Lecture Bureau would have
      provided for her amusement, on economical terms. And I reckon, if a
      married life would fix her, she might have tried it among Us by way of a
      change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the saddest part of the story,&rdquo; said Amelius. &ldquo;There came a time,
      only two years ago, when her prospects changed for the better. Her rich
      aunt (her mother&rsquo;s sister) died; and&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;left
      her a legacy of six thousand pounds. There was a gleam of sunshine in her
      life! The poor teacher was an heiress in a small way, with her fortune at
      her own disposal. They had something like a festival at home, for the
      first time; presents to everybody, and kissings and congratulations, and
      new dresses at last. And, more than that, another wonderful event happened
      before long. A gentleman made his appearance in the family circle, with an
      interesting object in view&mdash;a gentleman, who had called at the house
      in which she happened to be employed as teacher at the time, and had seen
      her occupied with her pupils. He had kept it to himself to be sure, but he
      had secretly admired her from that moment&mdash;and now it had come out!
      She had never had a lover before; mind that. And he was a remarkably
      handsome man: dressed beautifully, and sang and played, and was so humble
      and devoted with it all. Do you think it wonderful that she said Yes, when
      he proposed to marry her? I don&rsquo;t think it wonderful at all. For the first
      few weeks of the courtship, the sunshine was brighter than ever. Then the
      clouds began to rise. Anonymous letters came, describing the handsome
      gentleman (seen under his fair surface) as nothing less than a scoundrel.
      She tore up the letters indignantly&mdash;she was too delicate even to
      show them to him. Signed letters came next, addressed to her father by an
      uncle and an aunt, both containing one and the same warning: &lsquo;If your
      daughter insists on having him, tell her to take care of her money.&rsquo; A few
      days later, a visitor arrived&mdash;a brother, who spoke out more plainly
      still. As an honourable man, he could not hear of what was going on,
      without making the painful confession that his brother was forbidden to
      enter his house. That said, he washed his hands of all further
      responsibility. You two know the world, you will guess how it ended.
      Quarrels in the household; the poor middle-aged woman, living in her
      fool&rsquo;s paradise, blindly true to her lover; convinced that he was foully
      wronged; frantic when he declared that he would not connect himself with a
      family which suspected him. Ah, I have no patience when I think of it, and
      I almost wish I had never begun to tell the story! Do you know what he
      did? She was free of course, at her age, to decide for herself; there was
      no controlling her. The wedding day was fixed. Her father had declared he
      would not sanction it; and her step-mother kept him to his word. She went
      alone to the church, to meet her promised husband. He never appeared; he
      deserted her, mercilessly deserted her&mdash;after she had sacrificed her
      own relations to him&mdash;on her wedding-day. She was taken home
      insensible, and had a brain fever. The doctors declined to answer for her
      life. Her father thought it time to look to her banker&rsquo;s pass-book. Out of
      her six thousand pounds she had privately given no less than four thousand
      to the scoundrel who had deceived and forsaken her! Not a month afterwards
      he married a young girl&mdash;with a fortune of course. We read of such
      things in newspapers and books. But to have them brought home to one,
      after living one&rsquo;s own life among honest people&mdash;I tell you it
      stupefied me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said no more. Below them in the cabin, voices were laughing and
      talking, to a cheerful accompaniment of clattering knives and forks.
      Around them spread the exultant glory of sea and sky. All that they heard,
      all that they saw, was cruelty out of harmony with the miserable story
      which had just reached its end. With one accord the three men rose and
      paced the deck, feeling physically the same need of some movement to
      lighten their spirits. With one accord they waited a little, before the
      narrative was resumed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Mr. Hethcote was the first to speak again.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand the poor creature&rsquo;s motive in joining your Community,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;To a person of any sensibility her position, among such
      relatives as you describe, must have been simply unendurable after what
      had happened. How did she hear of Tadmor and the Socialists?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had read one of our books,&rdquo; Amelius answered; &ldquo;and she had her
      married sister at New York to go to. There were moments, after her
      recovery (she confessed it to me frankly), when the thought of suicide was
      in her mind. Her religious scruples saved her. She was kindly received by
      her sister and her sister&rsquo;s husband. They proposed to keep her with them
      to teach their children. No! the new life offered to her was too like the
      old life&mdash;she was broken in body and mind; she had no courage to face
      it. We have a resident agent in New York; and he arranged for her journey
      to Tadmor. There is a gleam of brightness, at any rate, in this part of
      her story. She blessed the day, poor soul, when she joined us. Never
      before had she found herself among such kind-hearted, unselfish, simple
      people. Never before&mdash;&rdquo; he abruptly checked himself, and looked a
      little confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obliging Rufus finished the sentence for him. &ldquo;Never before had she known
      a young man with such natural gifts of fascination as C.A.G. Don&rsquo;t you be
      too modest, sir; it doesn&rsquo;t pay, I assure you, in the nineteenth century.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius was not as ready with his laugh as usual. &ldquo;I wish I could drop it
      at the point we have reached now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But she has left Tadmor; and,
      in justice to her (after the scandals in the newspaper), I must tell you
      how she left it, and why. The mischief began when I was helping her out of
      the boat. Two of our young women met us on the bank of the lake, and asked
      me how I got on with my fishing. They didn&rsquo;t mean any harm&mdash;they were
      only in their customary good spirits. Still, there was no mistaking their
      looks and tones when they put the question. Miss Mellicent, in her
      confusion, made matters worse. She coloured up, and snatched her hand out
      of mine, and ran back to the house by herself. The girls, enjoying their
      own foolish joke, congratulated me on my prospects. I must have been out
      of sorts in some way&mdash;upset, perhaps, by what I had heard in the
      boat. Anyhow, I lost my temper, and <i>I</i> made matters worse, next. I
      said some angry words, and left them. The same evening I found a letter in
      my room. &lsquo;For your sake, I must not be seen alone with you again. It is
      hard to lose the comfort of your sympathy, but I must submit. Think of me
      as kindly as I think of you. It has done me good to open my heart to you.&rsquo; 
      Only those lines, signed by Mellicent&rsquo;s initials. I was rash enough to
      keep the letter, instead of destroying it. All might have ended well,
      nevertheless, if she had only held to her resolution. But, unluckily, my
      twenty-first birthday was close at hand; and there was talk of keeping it
      as a festival in the Community. I was up with sunrise when the day came;
      having some farming work to look after, and wanting to get it over in good
      time. My shortest way back to breakfast was through a wood. In the wood I
      met her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; Mr. Hethcote asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus expressed his opinion of the wisdom of putting this question with
      his customary plainness of language. &ldquo;When there&rsquo;s a rash thing to be done
      by a man and a woman together, sir, philosophers have remarked that it&rsquo;s
      always the woman who leads the way. Of course she was alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had a little present for me on my birthday,&rdquo; Amelius explained&mdash;&ldquo;a
      purse of her own making. And she was afraid of the ridicule of the young
      women, if she gave it to me openly. &lsquo;You have my heart&rsquo;s dearest wishes
      for your happiness; think of me sometimes, Amelius, when you open your
      purse.&rsquo; If you had been in my place, could you have told her to go away,
      when she said that, and put her gift into your hand? Not if she had been
      looking at you at the moment&mdash;I&rsquo;ll swear you couldn&rsquo;t have done it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lean yellow face of Rufus Dingwell relaxed for the first time into a
      broad grin. &ldquo;There are further particulars, sir, stated in the newspaper,&rdquo;
       he said slily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the newspaper!&rdquo; Amelius answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus bowed, serenely courteous, with the air of a man who accepted a
      British oath as an unwilling compliment paid by the old country to the
      American press. &ldquo;The newspaper report states, sir, that she kissed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; Amelius shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s an error of the press,&rdquo; Rufus persisted. &ldquo;Perhaps, <i>you</i>
      kissed <i>her?&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what I did,&rdquo; said Amelius savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote felt it necessary to interfere. He addressed Rufus in his
      most magnificent manner. &ldquo;In England, Mr. Dingwell, a gentleman is not in
      the habit of disclosing these&mdash;er&mdash;these&mdash;er, er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These kissings in a wood?&rdquo; suggested Rufus. &ldquo;In my country, sir, we do
      not regard kissing, in or out of a wood, in the light of a shameful
      proceeding. Quite the contrary, I do assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius recovered his temper. The discussion was becoming too ridiculous
      to be endured by the unfortunate person who was the object of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us make mountains out of molehills,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I did kiss her&mdash;there!
      A woman pressing the prettiest little purse you ever saw into your hand,
      and wishing you many happy returns of the day with the tears in her eyes;
      I should like to know what else was to be done but to kiss her. Ah, yes,
      smooth out your newspaper report, and have another look at it! She <i>did</i>
      rest her head on my shoulder, poor soul, and she <i>did</i> say, &lsquo;Oh,
      Amelius, I thought my heart was turned to stone; feel how you have made it
      beat!&rsquo; When I remembered what she had told me in the boat, I declare to
      God I almost burst out crying myself&mdash;it was so innocent and so
      pitiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus held out his hand with true American cordiality. &ldquo;I do assure you,
      sir, I meant no harm,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The right grit is in you, and no mistake&mdash;and
      there goes the newspaper!&rdquo; He rolled up the slip, and flung it overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hethcote nodded his entire approval of this proceeding. Amelius went
      on with his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m near the end now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I had known it would have taken so
      long to tell&mdash;never mind! We got out of the wood at last, Mr. Rufus;
      and left it without a suspicion that we had been watched. I was prudent
      enough (when it was too late, you will say) to suggest to her that we had
      better be careful for the future. Instead of taking it seriously, she
      laughed. &lsquo;Have you altered your mind, since you wrote to me?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;To
      be sure I have,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;When I wrote to you I forgot the difference
      between your age and mine. Nothing that <i>we</i> do will be taken
      seriously. I am afraid of their laughing at me, Amelius; but I am afraid
      of nothing else.&rsquo; I did my best to undeceive her. I told her plainly that
      people unequally matched in years&mdash;women older than men, as well as
      men older than women&mdash;were not uncommonly married among us. The
      council only looked to their being well suited in other ways, and declined
      to trouble itself about the question of age. I don&rsquo;t think I produced much
      effect; she seemed, for once in her life, poor thing, to be too happy to
      look beyond the passing moment. Besides, there was the birthday festival
      to keep her mind from dwelling on doubts and fears that were not agreeable
      to her. And the next day there was another event to occupy our attention&mdash;the
      arrival of the lawyer&rsquo;s letter from London, with the announcement of my
      inheritance on coming of age. It was settled, as you know, that I was to
      go out into the world, and to judge for myself; but the date of my
      departure was not fixed. Two days later, the storm that had been gathering
      for weeks past burst on us&mdash;we were cited to appear before the
      council to answer for an infraction of the Rules. Everything that I have
      confessed to you, and some things besides that I have kept to myself, lay
      formally inscribed on a sheet of paper placed on the council table&mdash;and
      pinned to the sheet of paper was Mellicent&rsquo;s letter to me, found in my
      room. I took the whole blame on myself, and insisted on being confronted
      with the unknown person who had informed against us. The council met this
      by a question:&mdash;&lsquo;Is the information, in any particular, false?&rsquo; 
      Neither of us could deny that it was, in every particular, true. Hearing
      this, the council decided that there was no need, on our own showing, to
      confront us with the informer. From that day to this, I have never known
      who the spy was. Neither Mellicent nor I had an enemy in the Community.
      The girls who had seen us on the lake, and some other members who had met
      us together, only gave their evidence on compulsion&mdash;and even then
      they prevaricated, they were so fond of us and so sorry for us. After
      waiting a day, the governing body pronounced their judgment. Their duty
      was prescribed to them by the Rules. We were sentenced to six months&rsquo; 
      absence from the Community; to return or not as we pleased. A hard
      sentence, gentlemen&mdash;whatever <i>we</i> may think of it&mdash;to
      homeless and friendless people, to the Fallen Leaves that had drifted to
      Tadmor. In my case it had been already arranged that I was to leave. After
      what had happened, my departure was made compulsory in four-and-twenty
      hours; and I was forbidden to return, until the date of my sentence had
      expired. In Mellicent&rsquo;s case they were still more strict. They would not
      trust her to travel by herself. A female member of the Community was
      appointed to accompany her to the house of her married sister at New York:
      she was ordered to be ready for the journey by sunrise the next morning.
      We both understood, of course, that the object of this was to prevent our
      travelling together. They might have saved themselves the trouble of
      putting obstacles in our way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as You were concerned, I suppose?&rdquo; said Mr. Hethcote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as She was concerned also,&rdquo; Amelius answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did she take it, sir?&rdquo; Rufus inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a composure that astonished us all,&rdquo; said Amelius. &ldquo;We had
      anticipated tears and entreaties for mercy. She stood up perfectly calm,
      far calmer than I was, with her head turned towards me, and her eyes
      resting quietly on my face. If you can imagine a woman whose whole being
      was absorbed in looking into the future; seeing what no mortal creature
      about her saw; sustained by hopes that no mortal creature about her could
      share&mdash;you may see her as I did, when she heard her sentence
      pronounced. The members of the Community, accustomed to take leave of an
      erring brother or sister with loving and merciful words, were all more or
      less distressed as they bade her farewell. Most of the women were in tears
      as they kissed her. They said the same kind words to her over and over
      again. &lsquo;We are heartily sorry for you, dear; we shall all be glad to
      welcome you back.&rsquo; They sang our customary hymn at parting&mdash;and broke
      down before they got to the end. It was <i>she</i> who consoled <i>them!</i>
      Not once, through all that melancholy ceremony, did she lose her strange
      composure, her rapt mysterious look. I was the last to say farewell; and I
      own I couldn&rsquo;t trust myself to speak. She held my hand in hers. For a
      moment, her face lighted up softly with a radiant smile&mdash;then the
      strange preoccupied expression flowed over her again, like shadow over a
      light. Her eyes, still looking into mine, seemed to look beyond me. She
      spoke low, in sad steady tones. &lsquo;Be comforted, Amelius; the end is not
      yet.&rsquo; She put her hands on my head, and drew it down to her. &lsquo;You will
      come back to me,&rsquo; she whispered&mdash;and kissed me on the forehead,
      before them all. When I looked up again, she was gone. I have neither seen
      her nor heard from her since. It&rsquo;s all told, gentlemen&mdash;and some of
      it has distressed me in the telling. Let me go away for a minute by
      myself, and look at the sea.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oh, Rufus Dingwell, it is such a rainy day! And the London street which I
      look out on from my hotel window presents such a dirty and such a
      miserable view! Do you know, I hardly feel like the same Amelius who
      promised to write to you when you left the steamer at Queenstown. My
      spirits are sinking; I begin to feel old. Am I in the right state of mind
      to tell you what are my first impressions of London? Perhaps I may alter
      my opinion. At present (this is between ourselves), I don&rsquo;t like London or
      London people&mdash;excepting two ladies, who, in very different ways,
      have interested and charmed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who are the ladies? I must tell you what I heard about them from Mr.
      Hethcote, before I present them to you on my own responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you left us, I found the last day of the voyage to Liverpool dull
      enough. Mr. Hethcote did not seem to feel it in the same way: on the
      contrary, he grew more familiar and confidential in his talk with me. He
      has some of the English stiffness, you see, and your American pace was a
      little too fast for him. On our last night on board, we had some more
      conversation about the Farnabys. You were not interested enough in the
      subject to attend to what he said about them while you were with us; but
      if you are to be introduced to the ladies, you must be interested now. Let
      me first inform you that Mr. and Mrs. Farnaby have no children; and let me
      add that they have adopted the daughter and orphan child of Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s
      sister. This sister, it seems, died many years ago, surviving her husband
      for a few months only. To complete the story of the past, death has also
      taken old Mr. Ronald, the founder of the stationer&rsquo;s business, and his
      wife, Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s mother. Dry facts these&mdash;I don&rsquo;t deny it; but
      there is something more interesting to follow. I have next to tell you how
      Mr. Hethcote first became acquainted with Mrs. Farnaby. Now, Rufus, we are
      coming to something romantic at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is some time since Mr. Hethcote ceased to perform his clerical duties,
      owing to a malady in the throat, which made it painful for him to take his
      place in the reading-desk or the pulpit. His last curacy attached him to a
      church at the West-end of London; and here, one Sunday evening, after he
      had preached the sermon, a lady in trouble came to him in the vestry for
      spiritual advice and consolation. She was a regular attendant at the
      church, and something which he had said in that evening&rsquo;s sermon had
      deeply affected her. Mr. Hethcote spoke with her afterwards on many
      occasions at home. He felt a sincere interest in her, but he disliked her
      husband; and, when he gave up his curacy, he ceased to pay visits to the
      house. As to what Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s troubles were, I can tell you nothing.
      Mr. Hethcote spoke very gravely and sadly when he told me that the subject
      of his conversations with her must be kept a secret. &ldquo;I doubt whether you
      and Mr. Farnaby will get on well together,&rdquo; he said to me; &ldquo;but I shall be
      astonished if you are not favourably impressed by his wife and her niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was all I knew when I presented my letter of introduction to Mr.
      Farnaby at his place of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a grand stone building, with great plate-glass windows&mdash;all
      renewed and improved, they told me, since old Mr. Ronald&rsquo;s time. My letter
      and my card went into an office at the back, and I followed them after a
      while. A lean, hard, middle-aged man, buttoned up tight in a black
      frock-coat, received me, holding my written introduction open in his hand.
      He had a ruddy complexion not commonly seen in Londoners, so far as my
      experience goes. His iron-gray hair and whiskers (especially the whiskers)
      were in wonderfully fine order&mdash;as carefully oiled and combed as if
      he had just come out of a barber&rsquo;s shop. I had been in the morning to the
      Zoological Gardens; his eyes, when he lifted them from the letter to me,
      reminded me of the eyes of the eagles&mdash;glassy and cruel. I have a
      fault that I can&rsquo;t cure myself of. I like people, or dislike them, at
      first sight, without knowing, in either case, whether they deserve it or
      not. In the one moment when our eyes met, I felt the devil in me. In plain
      English, I hated Mr. Farnaby!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; he began, in a loud, harsh, rasping voice. &ldquo;The
      letter you bring me takes me by surprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the writer was an old friend of yours,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old friend of mine,&rdquo; Mr. Farnaby answered, &ldquo;whose errors I deplore.
      When he joined your Community, I looked upon him as a lost man. I am
      surprised at his writing to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is quite likely I was wrong, knowing nothing of the usages of society
      in England. I thought this reception of me downright rude. I had laid my
      hat on a chair; I took it up in my hand again, and delivered a parting
      shot at the brute with the oily whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had known what you now tell me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I should not have troubled
      you by presenting that letter. Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This didn&rsquo;t in the least offend him. A curious smile broke out on his
      face; it widened his eyes, and it twitched up his mouth at one corner. He
      held out his hand to stop me. I waited, in case he felt bound to make an
      apology. He did nothing of the sort&mdash;he only made a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are young and hasty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I may lament my friend&rsquo;s
      extravagances, without failing on that account in what is due to an old
      friendship. You are probably not aware that we have no sympathy in England
      with Socialists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hit him back again. &ldquo;In that case, sir, a little Socialism in England
      would do you no harm. We consider it a part of our duty as Christians to
      feel sympathy with all men who are honest in their convictions&mdash;no
      matter how mistaken (in our opinion) the convictions may be.&rdquo; I rather
      thought I had him there; and I took up my hat again, to get off with the
      honours of victory while I had the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sincerely ashamed of myself, Rufus, in telling you all this. I ought
      to have given him back &ldquo;the soft answer that turneth away wrath&rdquo;&mdash;my
      conduct was a disgrace to my Community. What evil influence was at work in
      me? Was it the air of London? or was it a possession of the devil?
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped me for the second time&mdash;not in the least disconcerted by
      what I had said to him. His inbred conviction of his own superiority to a
      young adventurer like me was really something magnificent to witness. He
      did me justice&mdash;the Philistine-Pharisee did me justice! Will you
      believe it? He made his remarks next on my good points, as if I had been a
      young bull at a prize cattle show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me for noticing it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your manners are perfectly
      gentlemanlike, and you speak English without any accent. And yet you have
      been brought up in America. What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I grew worse and worse&mdash;I got downright sulky now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it means,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;that some of us, in America, cultivate
      ourselves as well as our land. We have our books and music, though you
      seem to think we only have our axes and spades. Englishmen don&rsquo;t claim a
      monopoly of good manners at Tadmor. We see no difference between an
      American gentleman and an English gentleman. And as for speaking English
      with an accent, the Americans accuse <i>us</i> of doing that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled again. &ldquo;How very absurd!&rdquo; he said, with a superb compassion for
      the benighted Americans. By this time, I suspect he began to feel that he
      had had enough of me. He got rid of me with an invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad to receive you at my private residence, and introduce you
      to my wife and her niece&mdash;our adopted daughter. There is the address.
      We have a few friends to dinner on Saturday next, at seven. Will you give
      us the pleasure of your company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We are all aware that there is a distinction between civility and
      cordiality; but I myself never knew how wide that distinction might be,
      until Mr. Farnaby invited me to dinner. If I had not been curious (after
      what Mr. Hethcote had told me) to see Mrs. Farnaby and her niece, I should
      certainly have slipped out of the engagement. As it was, I promised to
      dine with Oily-Whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand into mine at parting. It felt as moistly cold as a dead
      fish. After getting out again into the street, I turned into the first
      tavern I passed, and ordered a drink. Shall I tell you what else I did? I
      went into the lavatory, and washed Mr. Farnaby off my hand. (N.B.&mdash;If
      I had behaved in this way at Tadmor, I should have been punished with the
      lighter penalty&mdash;taking my meals by myself, and being forbidden to
      enter the Common Room for eight and forty hours.) I feel I am getting
      wickeder and wickeder in London&mdash;I have half a mind to join you in
      Ireland. What does Tom Moore say of his countrymen&mdash;he ought to know,
      I suppose? &ldquo;For though they love women and golden store: Sir Knight, they
      love honour and virtue more!&rdquo; They must have been all Socialists in Tom
      Moore&rsquo;s time. Just the place for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been obliged to wait a little. A dense fog has descended on us by
      way of variety. With a stinking coal fire, with the gas lit and the
      curtains drawn at half-past eleven in the forenoon, I feel that I am in my
      own country again at last. Patience, my friend&mdash;patience! I am coming
      to the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s private residence on the appointed day, I became
      acquainted with one more of the innumerable insincerities of modern
      English life. When a man asks you to dine with him at seven o&rsquo;clock, in
      other countries, he means what he says. In England, he means half-past
      seven, and sometimes a quarter to eight. At seven o&rsquo;clock I was the only
      person in Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s drawing-room. At ten minutes past seven, Mr.
      Farnaby made his appearance. I had a good mind to take his place in the
      middle of the hearth-rug, and say, &ldquo;Farnaby, I am glad to see you.&rdquo; But I
      looked at his whiskers; and <i>they</i> said to me, as plainly as words
      could speak, &ldquo;Better not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes more, Mrs. Farnaby joined us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I was a practised author&mdash;or, no, I would rather, for the
      moment, be a competent portrait-painter, and send you Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s
      likeness enclosed. How I am to describe her in words, I really don&rsquo;t know.
      My dear fellow, she almost frightened me. I never before saw such a woman;
      I never expect to see such a woman again. There was nothing in her figure,
      or in her way of moving, that produced this impression on me&mdash;she is
      little and fat, and walks with a firm, heavy step, like the step of a man.
      Her face is what I want to make you see as plainly as I saw it myself: it
      was her face that startled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as I can pretend to judge, she must have been pretty, in a healthy
      way, when she was young. I declare I hardly know whether she is not pretty
      now. She certainly has no marks or wrinkles; her hair either has no gray
      in it, or is too light to show the gray. She has preserved her fair
      complexion; perhaps with art to assist it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say. As for her
      lips&mdash;I am not speaking disrespectfully, I am only describing them
      truly, when I say that they invite kisses in spite of her. In two words,
      though she has been married (as I know from what one of the guests told me
      after dinner) for sixteen years, she would be still an irresistible little
      woman, but for the one startling drawback of her eyes. Don&rsquo;t mistake me.
      In themselves, they are large, well-opened blue eyes, and may at one time
      have been the chief attraction in her face. But now there is an expression
      of suffering in them&mdash;long, unsolaced suffering, as I believe&mdash;so
      despairing and so dreadful, that she really made my heart ache when I
      looked at her. I will swear to it, that woman lives in some secret hell of
      her own making, and longs for the release of death; and is so inveterately
      full of bodily life and strength, that she may carry her burden with her
      to the utmost verge of life. I am digging the pen into the paper, I feel
      this so strongly, and I am so wretchedly incompetent to express my
      feeling. Can you imagine a diseased mind, imprisoned in a healthy body? I
      don&rsquo;t care what doctors or books may say&mdash;it is that, and nothing
      else. Nothing else will solve the mystery of the smooth face, the fleshy
      figure, the firm step, the muscular grip of her hand when she gives it to
      you&mdash;and the soul in torment that looks at you all the while out of
      her eyes. It is useless to tell me that such a contradiction as this
      cannot exist. I have seen the woman; and she does exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes! I can fancy you grinning over my letter&mdash;I can hear you
      saying to yourself, &ldquo;Where did he pick up his experience, I wonder?&rdquo; I
      have no experience&mdash;I only have something that serves me instead of
      it, and I don&rsquo;t know what. The Elder Brother, at Tadmor, used to say it
      was sympathy. But <i>he</i> is a sentimentalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Mr. Farnaby presented me to his wife&mdash;and then walked away as
      if he was sick of us both, and looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason or other, Mrs. Farnaby seemed to be surprised, for the
      moment, by my personal appearance. Her husband had, very likely, not told
      her how young I was. She got over her momentary astonishment, and, signing
      to me to sit by her on the sofa, said the necessary words of welcome&mdash;evidently
      thinking something else all the time. The strange miserable eyes looked
      over my shoulder, instead of looking at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Farnaby tells me you have been living in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone in which she spoke was curiously quiet and monotonous. I have
      heard such tones, in the Far West, from lonely settlers without a
      neighbouring soul to speak to. Has Mrs. Farnaby no neighbouring soul to
      speak to, except at dinner parties?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an Englishman, are you not?&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said Yes, and cast about in my mind for something to say to her. She
      saved me the trouble by making me the victim of a complete series of
      questions. This, as I afterwards discovered, was <i>her</i> way of finding
      conversation for strangers. Have you ever met with absent-minded people to
      whom it is a relief to ask questions mechanically, without feeling the
      slightest interest in the answers?
    </p>
    <p>
      She began. &ldquo;Where did you live in America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Tadmor, in the State of Illinois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of place is Tadmor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I described the place as well as I could, under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you go to Tadmor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to reply to this, without speaking of the Community.
      Feeling that the subject was not in the least likely to interest her, I
      spoke as briefly as I could. To my astonishment, I evidently began to
      interest her from that moment. The series of questions went on&mdash;but
      now she not only listened, she was eager for the answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any women among you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly as many women as men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another change! Over the weary misery of her eyes there flashed a bright
      look of interest which completely transformed them. Her articulation even
      quickened when she put her next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are any of the women friendless creatures, who came to you from England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought of Mellicent as I spoke. Was this new interest that I had so
      innocently aroused, an interest in Mellicent? Her next question only added
      to my perplexity. Her next question proved that my guess had completely
      failed to hit the mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any <i>young</i> women among them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Farnaby, standing with his back to us thus far, suddenly turned and
      looked at her, when she inquired if there were &ldquo;young&rdquo; women among us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Mere girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed so near to me that her knees touched mine. &ldquo;How old?&rdquo; she
      asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Farnaby left the window, walked close up to the sofa, and deliberately
      interrupted us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nasty muggy weather, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose the climate of
      America&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby deliberately interrupted her husband. &ldquo;How old?&rdquo; she
      repeated, in a louder tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was bound, of course, to answer the lady of the house. &ldquo;Some girls from
      eighteen to twenty. And some younger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much younger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, from sixteen to seventeen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She grew more and more excited; she positively laid her hand on my arm in
      her eagerness to secure my attention all to herself. &ldquo;American girls or
      English?&rdquo; she resumed, her fat, firm fingers closing on me with a
      tremulous grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you be in town in November?&rdquo; said Mr. Farnaby, purposely
      interrupting us again. &ldquo;If you would like to see the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Show&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby impatiently shook me by the arm. &ldquo;American girls or English?&rdquo;
       she reiterated, more obstinately than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Farnaby gave her one look. If he could have put her on the blazing
      fire and have burnt her up in an instant by an effort of will, I believe
      he would have made the effort. He saw that I was observing him, and turned
      quickly from his wife to me. His ruddy face was pale with suppressed rage.
      My early arrival had given Mrs. Farnaby an opportunity of speaking to me,
      which he had not anticipated in inviting me to dinner. &ldquo;Come and see my
      pictures,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife still held me fast. Whether he liked it or not, I had again no
      choice but to answer her. &ldquo;Some American girls, and some English,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes opened wider and wider in unutterable expectation. She suddenly
      advanced her face so close to mine, that I felt her hot breath on my
      cheeks as the next words burst their way through her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Born in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Born at Tadmor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped my arm. The light died out of her eyes in an instant. In some
      inconceivable way, I had utterly destroyed some secret expectation that
      she had fixed on me. She actually left me on the sofa, and took a chair on
      the opposite side of the fireplace. Mr. Farnaby, turning paler and paler,
      stepped up to her as she changed her place. I rose to look at the pictures
      on the wall nearest to me. You remarked the extraordinary keenness of my
      sense of hearing, while we were fellow passengers on the steamship. When
      he stooped over her, and whispered in her ear, I heard him&mdash;though
      nearly the whole breadth of the room was between us. &ldquo;You hell-cat!&rdquo;&mdash;that
      was what Mr. Farnaby said to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock on the mantelpiece struck the half-hour after seven. In quick
      succession, the guests at the dinner now entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so staggered by the extraordinary scene of married life which I had
      just witnessed, that the guests produced only a very faint impression upon
      me. My mind was absorbed in trying to find the true meaning of what I had
      seen and heard. Was Mrs. Farnaby a little mad? I dismissed that idea as
      soon as it occurred to me; nothing that I had observed in her justified
      it. The truer conclusion appeared to be, that she was deeply interested in
      some absent (and possibly lost) young creature; whose age, judging by
      actions and tones which had sufficiently revealed that part of the secret
      to me, could not be more than sixteen or seventeen years. How long had she
      cherished the hope of seeing the girl, or hearing of her? It must have
      been, anyhow, a hope very deeply rooted, for she had been perfectly
      incapable of controlling herself when I had accidentally roused it. As for
      her husband, there could be no doubt that the subject was not merely
      distasteful to him, but so absolutely infuriating that he could not even
      keep his temper, in the presence of a third person invited to his house.
      Had he injured the girl in any way? Was he responsible for her
      disappearance? Did his wife know it, or only suspect it? Who <i>was</i>
      the girl? What was the secret of Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s extraordinary interest in
      her&mdash;Mrs. Farnaby, whose marriage was childless; whose interest one
      would have thought should be naturally concentrated on her adopted
      daughter, her sister&rsquo;s orphan child? In conjectures such as these, I
      completely lost myself. Let me hear what your ingenuity can make of the
      puzzle; and let me return to Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s dinner, waiting on Mr.
      Farnaby&rsquo;s table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant threw open the drawing-room door, and the most honoured guest
      present led Mrs. Farnaby to the dining-room. I roused myself to some
      observation of what was going on about me. No ladies had been invited; and
      the men were all of a certain age. I looked in vain for the charming
      niece. Was she not well enough to appear at the dinner-party? I ventured
      on putting the question to Mr. Farnaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find her at the tea-table, when we return to the drawing-room.
      Girls are out of place at dinner-parties.&rdquo; So he answered me&mdash;not
      very graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I stepped out on the landing, I looked up; I don&rsquo;t know why, unless I
      was the unconscious object of magnetic attraction. Anyhow, I had my
      reward. A bright young face peeped over the balusters of the upper
      staircase, and modestly withdrew itself again in a violent hurry.
      Everybody but Mr. Farnaby and myself had disappeared in the dining-room.
      Was she having a peep at the young Socialist?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another interruption to my letter, caused by another change in the
      weather. The fog has vanished; the waiter is turning off the gas, and
      letting in the drab-coloured daylight. I ask him if it is still raining.
      He smiles, and rubs his hands, and says, &ldquo;It looks like clearing up soon,
      sir.&rdquo; This man&rsquo;s head is gray; he has been all his life a waiter in London&mdash;and
      he can still see the cheerful side of things. What native strength of mind
      cast away on a vocation that is unworthy of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;and now about the Farnaby dinner. I feel a tightness in the
      lower part of my waistcoat, Rufus, when I think of the dinner; there was
      such a quantity of it, and Mr. Farnaby was so tyrannically resolute in
      forcing his luxuries down the throats of his guests. His eye was on me, if
      I let my plate go away before it was empty&mdash;his eye said &ldquo;I have paid
      for this magnificent dinner, and I mean to see you eat it.&rdquo; Our printed
      list of the dishes, as they succeeded each other, also informed us of the
      varieties of wine which it was imperatively necessary to drink with each
      dish. I got into difficulties early in the proceedings. The taste of
      sherry, for instance, is absolutely nauseous to me; and Rhine wine turns
      into vinegar ten minutes after it has passed my lips. I asked for the wine
      that I could drink, out of its turn. You should have seen Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s
      face, when I violated the rules of his dinner-table! It was the one
      amusing incident of the feast&mdash;the one thing that alleviated the
      dreary and mysterious spectacle of Mrs. Farnaby. There she sat, with her
      mind hundreds of miles away from everything that was going on about her,
      entangling the two guests, on her right hand and on her left, in a network
      of vacant questions, just as she had entangled me. I discovered that one
      of these gentlemen was a barrister and the other a ship-owner, by the
      answers which Mrs. Farnaby absently extracted from them on the subject of
      their respective vocations in life. And while she questioned incessantly,
      she ate incessantly. Her vigorous body insisted on being fed. She would
      have emptied her wineglass (I suspect) as readily as she plied her knife
      and fork&mdash;but I discovered that a certain system of restraint was
      established in the matter of wine. At intervals, Mr. Farnaby just looked
      at the butler&mdash;and the butler and his bottle, on those occasions,
      deliberately passed her by. Not the slightest visible change was produced
      in her by the eating and drinking; she was equal to any demands that any
      dinner could make on her. There was no flush in her face, no change in her
      spirits, when she rose, in obedience to English custom, and retired to the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left together over their wine, the men began to talk politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened at the outset, expecting to get some information. Our readings
      in modern history at Tadmor had informed us of the dominant political
      position of the middle classes in England, since the time of the first
      Reform Bill. Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s guests represented the respectable mediocrity
      of social position, the professional and commercial average of the nation.
      They all talked glibly enough&mdash;I and an old gentleman who sat next to
      me being the only listeners. I had spent the morning lazily in the
      smoking-room of the hotel, reading the day&rsquo;s newspapers. And what did I
      hear now, when the politicians set in for their discussion? I heard the
      leading articles of the day&rsquo;s newspapers translated into bald chat, and
      coolly addressed by one man to another, as if they were his own individual
      views on public affairs! This absurd imposture positively went the round
      of the table, received and respected by everybody with a stolid solemnity
      of make-believe which it was downright shameful to see. Not a man present
      said, &ldquo;I saw that today in the <i>Times</i> or the <i>Telegraph.&rdquo;</i> Not
      a man present had an opinion of his own; or, if he had an opinion,
      ventured to express it; or, if he knew nothing of the subject, was honest
      enough to say so. One enormous Sham, and everybody in a conspiracy to take
      it for the real thing: that is an accurate description of the state of
      political feeling among the representative men at Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s dinner. I
      am not judging rashly by one example only; I have been taken to clubs and
      public festivals, only to hear over and over again what I heard in Mr.
      Farnaby&rsquo;s dining-room. Does it need any great foresight to see that such a
      state of things as this cannot last much longer, in a country which has
      not done with reforming itself yet? The time is coming, in England, when
      the people who <i>have</i> opinions of their own will be heard, and when
      Parliament will be forced to open the door to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a nice outbreak of republican freedom! What does my long-suffering
      friend think of it&mdash;waiting all the time to be presented to Mr.
      Farnaby&rsquo;s niece? Everything in its place, Rufus. The niece followed the
      politics, at the time; and she shall follow them now.
    </p>
    <p>
      You shall hear first what my next neighbour said of her&mdash;a quaint old
      fellow, a retired doctor, if I remember correctly. He seemed to be as
      weary of the second-hand newspaper talk as I was; he quite sparkled and
      cheered up when I introduced the subject of Miss Regina. Have I mentioned
      her name yet? If not, here it is for you in full:&mdash;Miss Regina
      Mildmay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call her the brown girl,&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;Brown hair, brown
      eyes, and a brown skin. No, not a brunette; not dark enough for that&mdash;a
      warm, delicate brown; wait till you see it! Takes after her father, I
      should tell you. He was a fine-looking man in his time; foreign blood in
      his veins, by his mother&rsquo;s side. Miss Regina gets her queer name by being
      christened after his mother. Never mind her name; she&rsquo;s a charming person.
      Let&rsquo;s drink her health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We drank her health. Remembering that he had called her &ldquo;the brown girl,&rdquo;
       I said I supposed she was still quite young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than young,&rdquo; the doctor answered; &ldquo;in the prime of life. I call
      her a girl, by habit. Wait till you see her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she a good figure, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! you&rsquo;re like the Turks, are you? A nice-looking woman doesn&rsquo;t content
      you&mdash;you must have her well-made too. We can accommodate you, sir; we
      are slim and tall, with a swing of our hips, and we walk like a goddess.
      Wait and see how her head is put on her shoulders&mdash;I say no more.
      Proud? Not she! A simple, unaffected, kind-hearted creature. Always the
      same; I never saw her out of temper in my life; I never heard her speak
      ill of anybody. The man who gets her will be a man to be envied, I can
      tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she engaged to be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She has had plenty of offers; but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to care for
      anything of that sort&mdash;so far. Devotes herself to Mrs. Farnaby, and
      keeps up her school-friendships. A splendid creature, with the vital
      thermometer at temperate heart&mdash;a calm, meditative, equable person.
      Pass me the olives. Only think! the man who discovered olives is unknown;
      no statue of him erected in any part of the civilized earth. I know few
      more remarkable instances of human ingratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I risked a bold question&mdash;but not on the subject of olives. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
      Miss Regina&rsquo;s life rather a dull one in this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor cautiously lowered his voice. &ldquo;It would be dull enough to some
      women. Regina&rsquo;s early life has been a hard one. Her mother was Mr.
      Ronald&rsquo;s eldest daughter. The old brute never forgave her for marrying
      against his wishes. Mrs. Ronald did all she could, secretly, to help the
      young wife in disgrace. But old Ronald had sole command of the money, and
      kept it to himself. From Regina&rsquo;s earliest childhood there was always
      distress at home. Her father harassed by creditors, trying one scheme
      after another, and failing in all; her mother and herself, half starved&mdash;with
      their very bedclothes sometimes at the pawnbrokers. I attended them in
      their illnesses, and though they hid their wretchedness from everybody
      else (proud as Lucifer, both of them!), they couldn&rsquo;t hide it from me.
      Fancy the change to this house! I don&rsquo;t say that living here in clover is
      enough for such a person as Regina; I only say it has its influence. She
      is one of those young women, sir, who delight in sacrificing themselves to
      others&mdash;she is devoted, for instance, to Mrs. Farnaby. I only hope
      Mrs. Farnaby is worthy of it! Not that it matters to Regina. What she
      does, she does out of her own sweetness of disposition. She brightens this
      household, I can tell you! Farnaby did a wise thing, in his own domestic
      interests, when he adopted her as his daughter. She thinks she can never
      be grateful enough to him&mdash;the good creature!&mdash;though she has
      repaid him a hundredfold. He&rsquo;ll find that out, one of these days, when a
      husband takes her away. Don&rsquo;t suppose that I want to disparage our host&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      an old friend of mine; but he&rsquo;s a little too apt to take the good things
      that fall to his lot as if they were nothing but a just recognition of his
      own merits. I have told him that to his face, often enough to have a right
      to say it of him when he doesn&rsquo;t hear me. Do you smoke? I wish they would
      drop their politics, and take to tobacco. I say Farnaby! I want a cigar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This broad hint produced an adjournment to the smoking-room, the doctor
      leading the way. I began to wonder how much longer my introduction to Miss
      Regina was to be delayed. It was not to come until I had seen a new side
      of my host&rsquo;s character, and had found myself promoted to a place of my own
      in Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we rose from table one of the guests spoke to me of a visit that he had
      recently paid to the part of Buckinghamshire which I come from. &ldquo;I was
      shown a remarkably picturesque old house on the heath,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They
      told me it had been inhabited for centuries by the family of the
      Goldenhearts. Are you in any way related to them?&rdquo; I answered that I was
      very nearly related, having been born in the house&mdash;and there, as I
      suppose, the matter ended. Being the youngest man of the party, I waited,
      of course, until the rest of the gentlemen had passed out to the
      smoking-room. Mr. Farnaby and I were left together. To my astonishment, he
      put his arm cordially into mine, and led me out of the dining-room with
      the genial familiarity of an old friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you such a cigar,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as you can&rsquo;t buy for money in all
      London. You have enjoyed yourself, I hope? Now we know what wine you like,
      you won&rsquo;t have to ask the butler for it next time. Drop in any day, and
      take pot-luck with us.&rdquo; He came to a standstill in the hall; his brassy
      rasping voice assumed a new tone&mdash;a sort of parody of respect. &ldquo;Have
      you been to your family place,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;since your return to England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had evidently heard the few words exchanged between his friend and
      myself. It seemed odd that he should take any interest in a place
      belonging to people who were strangers to him. However, his question was
      easily answered. I had only to inform him that my father had sold the
      house when he left England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Those old family places ought
      to be kept up. The greatness of England, sir, strikes its roots in the old
      families of England. They may be rich, or they may be poor&mdash;that
      don&rsquo;t matter. An old family <i>is</i> an old family; it&rsquo;s sad to see their
      hearths and homes sold to wealthy manufacturers who don&rsquo;t know who their
      own grandfathers were. Would you allow me to ask what is the family motto
      of the Goldenhearts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shall I own the truth? The bottles circulated freely at Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s
      table&mdash;I began to wonder whether he was quite sober. I said I was
      sorry to disappoint him, but I really did not know what my family motto
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unaffectedly shocked. &ldquo;I think I saw a ring on your finger,&rdquo; he
      said, as soon as he recovered himself. He lifted my left hand in his own
      cold-fishy paw. The one ring I wear is of plain gold; it belonged to my
      father and it has his initials inscribed on the signet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, you haven&rsquo;t got your coat-of-arms on your seal!&rdquo; cried Mr.
      Farnaby. &ldquo;My dear sir, I am old enough to be your father, and I must take
      the freedom of remonstrating with you. Your coat-of-arms and your motto
      are no doubt at the Heralds&rsquo; Office&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you apply for them?
      Shall I go there for you? I will do it with pleasure. You shouldn&rsquo;t be
      careless about these things&mdash;you shouldn&rsquo;t indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I listened in speechless astonishment. Was he ironically expressing his
      contempt for old families? We got into the smoking-room at last; and my
      friend the doctor enlightened me privately in a corner. Every word Mr.
      Farnaby had said had been spoken in earnest. This man, who owes his rise
      from the lowest social position entirely to himself&mdash;who, judging by
      his own experience, has every reason to despise the poor pride of ancestry&mdash;actually
      feels a sincerely servile admiration for the accident of birth! &ldquo;Oh, poor
      human nature!&rdquo; as Somebody says. How cordially I agree with Somebody!
    </p>
    <p>
      We went up to the drawing-room; and I was introduced to &ldquo;the brown girl&rdquo;
       at last. What impression did she produce on me?
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know, Rufus, there is some perverse reluctance in me to go on with
      this inordinately long letter just when I have arrived at the most
      interesting part of it. I can&rsquo;t account for my own state of mind; I only
      know that it is so. The difficulty of describing the young lady doesn&rsquo;t
      perplex me like the difficulty of describing Mrs. Farnaby. I can see her
      now, as vividly as if she was present in the room. I even remember (and
      this is astonishing in a man) the dress that she wore. And yet I shrink
      from writing about her, as if there was something wrong in it. Do me a
      kindness, good friend, and let me send off all these sheets of paper, the
      idle work of an idle morning, just as they are. When I write next, I
      promise to be ashamed of my own capricious state of mind, and to paint the
      portrait of Miss Regina at full length.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean while, don&rsquo;t run away with the idea that she has made a
      disagreeable impression upon me. Good heavens! it is far from that. You
      have had the old doctor&rsquo;s opinion of her. Very well. Multiply this opinion
      by ten&mdash;and you have mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      [NOTE:&mdash;A strange indorsement appears on this letter, dated several
      months after the period at which it was received:&mdash;<i>&ldquo;Ah, poor
      Amelius! He had better have gone back to Miss Mellicent, and put up with
      the little drawback of her age. What a bright, lovable fellow he was!
      Goodbye to Goldenheart!&rdquo;</i>

      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      I particularly want you to come and lunch with us, dearest Cecilia, the
      day after tomorrow. Don&rsquo;t say to yourself, &ldquo;The Farnaby&rsquo;s house is dull,
      and Regina is too slow for me,&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t think about the long drive for
      the horses, from your place to London. This letter has an interest of its
      own, my dear&mdash;I have got something new for you. What do you think of
      a young man, who is clever and handsome and agreeable&mdash;and, wonder of
      wonders, quite unlike any other young Englishman you ever saw in your
      life? You are to meet him at luncheon; and you are to get used to his
      strange name beforehand. For which purpose I enclose his card.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his first appearance at our house, at dinner yesterday evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was presented to me at the tea-table, he was not to be put off
      with a bow&mdash;he insisted on shaking hands. &ldquo;Where I have been,&rdquo; he
      explained, &ldquo;we help a first introduction with a little cordiality.&rdquo; He
      looked into his tea-cup, after he said that, with the air of a man who
      could say something more, if he had a little encouragement. Of course, I
      encouraged him. &ldquo;I suppose shaking hands is much the same form in America
      that bowing is in England?&rdquo; I said, as suggestively as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up directly, and shook his head. &ldquo;We have too many forms in this
      country,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The virtue of hospitality, for instance, seems to have
      become a form in England. In America, when a new acquaintance says, &lsquo;Come
      and see me,&rsquo; he means it. When he says it here, in nine cases out of ten
      he looks unaffectedly astonished if you are fool enough to take him at his
      word. I hate insincerity, Miss Regina&mdash;and now I have returned to my
      own country, I find insincerity one of the established institutions of
      English Society. &lsquo;Can we do anything for you?&rsquo; Ask them to do something
      for you&mdash;and you will see what it means. &lsquo;Thank you for such a
      pleasant evening!&rsquo; Get into the carriage with them when they go home&mdash;and
      you will find that it means, &lsquo;What a bore!&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, Mr. So-and-so, allow me
      to congratulate you on your new appointment.&rsquo; Mr. So-and-so passes out of
      hearing&mdash;and you discover what the congratulations mean. &lsquo;Corrupt old
      brute! he has got the price of his vote at the last division.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, Mr.
      Blank, what a charming book you have written!&rsquo; Mr. Blank passes out of
      hearing&mdash;and you ask what his book is about. &lsquo;To tell you the truth,
      I haven&rsquo;t read it. Hush! he&rsquo;s received at Court; one must say these
      things.&rsquo; The other day a friend took me to a grand dinner at the Lord
      Mayor&rsquo;s. I accompanied him first to his club; many distinguished guests
      met there before going to the dinner. Heavens, how they spoke of the Lord
      Mayor! One of them didn&rsquo;t know his name, and didn&rsquo;t want to know it;
      another wasn&rsquo;t certain whether he was a tallow-chandler or a button-maker;
      a third, who had met with him somewhere, described him as a damned ass; a
      fourth said, &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be hard on him; he&rsquo;s only a vulgar old Cockney,
      without an <i>h</i> in his whole composition.&rsquo; A chorus of general
      agreement followed, as the dinner-hour approached: &lsquo;What a bore!&rsquo; I
      whispered to my friend, &lsquo;Why do they go?&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;You see, one must
      do this sort of thing.&rsquo; And when we got to the Mansion House, they did
      that sort of thing with a vengeance! When the speech-making set in, these
      very men who had been all expressing their profound contempt for the Lord
      Mayor behind his back, now flattered him to his face in such a shamelessly
      servile way, with such a meanly complete insensibility to their own
      baseness, that I did really and literally turn sick. I slipped out into
      the fresh air, and fumigated myself, after the company I had kept, with a
      cigar. No, no! it&rsquo;s useless to excuse these things (I could quote dozens
      of other instances that have come under my own observation) by saying that
      they are trifles. When trifles make themselves habits of yours or of mine,
      they become a part of your character or mine. We have an inveterately
      false and vicious system of society in England. If you want to trace one
      of the causes, look back to the little organized insincerities of English
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course you understand, Cecilia, that this was not all said at one
      burst, as I have written it here. Some of it came out in the way of
      answers to my inquiries, and some of it was spoken in the intervals of
      laughing, talking, and tea-drinking. But I want to show you how very
      different this young man is from the young men whom we are in the habit of
      meeting, and so I huddle his talk together in one sample, as Papa Farnaby
      would call it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear, he is decidedly handsome (I mean our delightful Amelius); his
      face has a bright, eager look, indescribably refreshing as a contrast to
      the stolid composure of the ordinary young Englishman. His smile is
      charming; he moves as gracefully&mdash;with as little self-consciousness&mdash;as
      my Italian greyhound. He has been brought up among the strangest people in
      America; and (would you believe it?) he is actually a Socialist. Don&rsquo;t be
      alarmed. He shocked us all dreadfully by declaring that his Socialism was
      entirely learnt out of the New Testament. I have looked at the New
      Testament, since he mentioned some of his principles to me; and, do you
      know, I declare it is true!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I forgot&mdash;the young Socialist plays and sings! When we asked him
      to go to the piano, he got up and began directly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do it well
      enough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to want a great deal of pressing.&rdquo; He sang old English
      songs, with great taste and sweetness. One of the gentlemen of our party,
      evidently disliking him, spoke rather rudely, I thought. &ldquo;A Socialist who
      sings and plays,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a harmless Socialist indeed. I begin to
      feel that my balance is safe at my banker&rsquo;s, and that London won&rsquo;t be set
      on fire with petroleum this time.&rdquo; He got his answer, I can tell you. &ldquo;Why
      should we set London on fire? London takes a regular percentage of your
      income from you, sir, whether you like it or not, on sound Socialist
      principles. You are the man who has got the money, and Socialism says:&mdash;You
      must and shall help the man who has got none. That is exactly what your
      own Poor Law says to you, every time the collector leaves the paper at
      your house.&rdquo; Wasn&rsquo;t it clever?&mdash;and it was doubly severe, because it
      was good-humouredly said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between ourselves, Cecilia, I think he is struck with me. When I walked
      about the room, his bright eyes followed me everywhere. And, when I took a
      chair by somebody else, not feeling it quite right to keep him all to
      myself, he invariably contrived to find a seat on the other side of me.
      His voice, too, had a certain tone, addressed to me, and to no other
      person in the room. Judge for yourself when you come here; but don&rsquo;t jump
      to conclusions, if you please. Oh no&mdash;I am not going to fall in love
      with him! It isn&rsquo;t in me to fall in love with anybody. Do you remember
      what the last man whom I refused said of me? &ldquo;She has a machine on the
      left side of her that pumps blood through her body, but she has no heart.&rdquo;
       I pity the woman who marries <i>that</i> man!
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing more, my dear. This curious Amelius seems to notice trifles
      which escape men in general, just as <i>we</i> do. Towards the close of
      the evening, poor Mamma Farnaby fell into one of her vacant states; half
      asleep and half awake on the sofa in the back drawing-room. &ldquo;Your aunt
      interests me,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;She must have suffered some terrible sorrow,
      at some past time in her life.&rdquo; Fancy a man seeing that! He dropped some
      hints, which showed that he was puzzling his brains to discover how I got
      on with her, and whether I was in her confidence or not: he even went the
      length of asking what sort of life I led with the uncle and aunt who have
      adopted me. My dear, it was done so delicately, with such irresistible
      sympathy and such a charming air of respect, that I was quite startled
      when I remembered, in the wakeful hours of the night, how freely I had
      spoken to him. Not that I have betrayed any secrets; for, as you know, I
      am as ignorant as everybody else of what the early troubles of my poor
      dear aunt may have been. But I did tell him how I came into the house a
      helpless little orphan girl; and how generously these two good relatives
      adopted me; and how happy it made me to find that I could really do
      something to cheer their sad childless lives. &ldquo;I wish I was half as good
      as you are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand how you became fond of Mrs.
      Farnaby. Perhaps it began in sympathy and compassion?&rdquo; Just think of that,
      from a young Englishman! He went on confessing his perplexities, as if we
      had known one another from childhood. &ldquo;I am a little surprised to see Mrs.
      Farnaby present at parties of this sort; I should have thought she would
      have stayed in her own room.&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what she objects to do,&rdquo; I
      answered; &ldquo;She says people will report that her husband is ashamed of her,
      or that she is not fit to be seen in society, if she doesn&rsquo;t appear at the
      parties&mdash;and she is determined not to be misrepresented in that way.&rdquo;
       Can you understand my talking to him with so little reserve? It is a
      specimen, Cecilia, of the odd manner in which my impulses carry me away,
      in this man&rsquo;s company. He is so nice and gentle&mdash;and yet so manly. I
      shall be curious to see if you can resist him, with your superior firmness
      and knowledge of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the strangest incident of all I have not told you yet&mdash;feeling
      some hesitation about the best way of describing it, so as to interest you
      in what has deeply interested me. I must tell it as plainly as I can, and
      leave it to speak for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who do you think has invited Amelius Goldenheart to luncheon? Not Papa
      Farnaby, who only invites him to dinner. Not I, it is needless to say. Who
      is it, then? Mamma Farnaby herself. He has actually so interested her that
      she has been thinking of him, and dreaming of him, in his absence!
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard her last night, poor thing, talking and grinding her teeth in her
      sleep; and I went into her room to try if I could quiet her, in the usual
      way, by putting my cool hand on her forehead, and pressing it gently. (The
      old doctor says it&rsquo;s magnetism, which is ridiculous.) Well, it didn&rsquo;t
      succeed this time; she went on muttering, and making that dreadful sound
      with her teeth. Occasionally a word was spoken clearly enough to be
      intelligible. I could make no connected sense of what I heard; but I could
      positively discover this&mdash;that she was dreaming of our guest from
      America!
    </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing about it, of course, when I went upstairs with her cup of
      tea this morning. What do you think was the first thing she asked for?
      Pen, ink, and paper. Her next request was that I would write Mr.
      Goldenheart&rsquo;s address on an envelope. &ldquo;Are you going to write to him?&rdquo; I
      asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want to speak to him, while John is out of the
      way at business,&rdquo; &ldquo;Secrets?&rdquo; I said, turning it off with a laugh. She
      answered, speaking gravely and earnestly. &ldquo;Yes; secrets.&rdquo; The letter was
      written, and sent to his hotel, inviting him to lunch with us on the first
      day when he was disengaged. He has replied, appointing the day after
      tomorrow. By way of trying to penetrate the mystery, I inquired if she
      wished me to appear at the luncheon. She considered with herself, before
      she answered that. &ldquo;I want him to be amused, and put in a good humour,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;before I speak to him. You must lunch with us&mdash;and ask
      Cecilia.&rdquo; She stopped, and considered once more. &ldquo;Mind one thing,&rdquo; she
      went on. &ldquo;Your uncle is to know nothing about it. If you tell him, I will
      never speak to you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Is this not extraordinary? Whatever her dream may have been, it has
      evidently produced a strong impression on her. I firmly believe she means
      to take him away with her to her own room, when the luncheon is over.
      Dearest Cecilia, you must help me to stop this! I have never been trusted
      with her secrets; they may, for all I know, be innocent secrets enough,
      poor soul! But it is surely in the highest degree undesirable that she
      should take into her confidence a young man who is only an acquaintance of
      ours: she will either make herself ridiculous, or do something worse. If
      Mr. Farnaby finds it out, I really tremble for what may happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of old friendship, don&rsquo;t leave me to face this difficulty by
      myself. A line, only one line, dearest, to say that you will not fail me.

      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is an afternoon concert; and modern German music was largely
      represented on the programme. The patient English people sat in
      closely-packed rows, listening to the pretentious instrumental noises
      which were impudently offered to them as a substitute for melody. While
      these docile victims of the worst of all quackeries (musical quackery)
      were still toiling through their first hour of endurance, a passing ripple
      of interest stirred the stagnant surface of the audience caused by the
      sudden rising of a lady overcome by the heat. She was quickly led out of
      the concert-room (after whispering a word of explanation to two young
      ladies seated at her side) by a gentleman who made a fourth member of the
      party. Left by themselves, the young ladies looked at each other,
      whispered to each other, half rose from their places, became confusedly
      conscious that the wandering attention of the audience was fixed on them,
      and decided at last on following their companions out of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lady who had preceded them had some reason of her own for not
      waiting to recover herself in the vestibule. When the gentleman in charge
      of her asked if he should get a glass of water, she answered sharply, &ldquo;Get
      a cab&mdash;and be quick about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cab was found in a moment; the gentleman got in after her, by the
      lady&rsquo;s invitation. &ldquo;Are you better now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never had anything the matter with me,&rdquo; she replied, quietly;
      &ldquo;tell the man to drive faster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having obeyed his instructions, the gentleman (otherwise Amelius) began to
      look a little puzzled. The lady (Mrs. Farnaby herself) perceived his
      condition of mind, and favoured him with an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had my own motive for asking you to luncheon today,&rdquo; she began, in that
      steady downright way of speaking that was peculiar to her. &ldquo;I wanted to
      have a word with you privately. My niece Regina&mdash;don&rsquo;t be surprised
      at my calling her my niece, when you have heard Mr. Farnaby call her his
      daughter. She <i>is</i> my niece. Adopting her is a mere phrase. It
      doesn&rsquo;t alter facts; it doesn&rsquo;t make her Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s child or mine, does
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had ended with a question, but she seemed to want no answer to it. Her
      face was turned towards the cab-window, instead of towards Amelius. He was
      one of those rare people who are capable of remaining silent when they
      have nothing to say. Mrs. Farnaby went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My niece Regina is a good creature in her way; but she suspects people.
      She has some reason of her own for trying to prevent me from taking you
      into my confidence; and her friend Cecilia is helping her. Yes, yes; the
      concert was the obstacle which they had arranged to put in my way. You
      were obliged to go, after telling them you wanted to hear the music; and I
      couldn&rsquo;t complain, because they had got a fourth ticket for me. I made up
      my mind what to do; and I have done it. Nothing wonderful in my being
      taken ill with the heat; nothing wonderful in your doing your duty as a
      gentleman and looking after me&mdash;and what is the consequence? Here we
      are together, on our way to my room, in spite of them. Not so bad for a
      poor helpless creature like me, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly wondering what it all meant, and what she could possibly want
      with him, Amelius suggested that the young ladies might leave the
      concert-room, and, not finding them in the vestibule, might follow them
      back to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby turned her head from the window, and looked him in the face
      for the first time. &ldquo;I have been a match for them so far,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;leave it to me, and you will find I can be a match for them still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After saying this, she watched the puzzled face of Amelius with a moment&rsquo;s
      steady scrutiny. Her full lips relaxed into a faint smile; her head sank
      slowly on her bosom. &ldquo;I wonder whether he thinks I am a little crazy?&rdquo; she
      said quietly to herself. &ldquo;Some women in my place would have gone mad years
      ago. Perhaps it might have been better for <i>me?&rdquo;</i> She looked up again
      at Amelius. &ldquo;I believe you are a good-tempered fellow,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Are
      you in your usual temper now? Did you enjoy your lunch? Has the lively
      company of the young ladies put you in a good humour with women generally?
      I want you to be in a particularly good humour with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke quite gravely. Amelius, a little to his own astonishment, found
      himself answering gravely on his side; assuring her, in the most
      conventional terms, that he was entirely at her service. Something in her
      manner affected him disagreeably. If he had followed his impulse, he would
      have jumped out of the cab, and have recovered his liberty and his
      light-heartedness at one and the same moment, by running away at the top
      of his speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver turned into the street in which Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s house was
      situated. Mrs. Farnaby stopped him, and got out at some little distance
      from the door. &ldquo;You think the young ones will follow us back,&rdquo; she said to
      Amelius. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, the servants will have nothing to tell them
      if they do.&rdquo; She checked him in the act of knocking, when they reached the
      house door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tea-time downstairs,&rdquo; she whispered, looking at her
      watch. &ldquo;You and I are going into the house, without letting the servants
      know anything about it. <i>Now</i> do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She produced from her pocket a steel ring, with several keys attached to
      it. &ldquo;A duplicate of Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s key,&rdquo; she explained, as she chose one,
      and opened the street door. &ldquo;Sometimes, when I find myself waking in the
      small hours of the morning, I can&rsquo;t endure my bed; I must go out and walk.
      My key lets me in again, just as it lets us in now, without disturbing
      anybody. You had better say nothing about it to Mr. Farnaby. Not that it
      matters much; for I should refuse to give up my key if he asked me. But
      you&rsquo;re a good-natured fellow&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t want to make bad blood
      between man and wife, do you? Step softly, and follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius hesitated. There was something repellent to him in entering
      another man&rsquo;s house under these clandestine conditions. &ldquo;All right!&rdquo;
       whispered Mrs. Farnaby, perfectly understanding him. &ldquo;Consult your
      dignity; go out again, and knock at the door, and ask if I am at home. I
      only wanted to prevent a fuss and an interruption when Regina comes back.
      If the servants don&rsquo;t know we are here, they will tell her we haven&rsquo;t
      returned&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would have been absurd to contest the matter, after this. Amelius
      followed her submissively to the farther end of the hall. There, she
      opened the door of a long narrow room, built out at the back of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my den,&rdquo; she said, signing to Amelius to pass in. &ldquo;While we are
      here, nobody will disturb us.&rdquo; She laid aside her bonnet and shawl, and
      pointed to a box of cigars on the table. &ldquo;Take one,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;I smoke
      too, when nobody sees me. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons, I dare say, why
      Regina wished to keep you out of my room. I find smoking composes me. What
      do <i>you</i> say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lit a cigar, and handed the matches to Amelius. Finding that he stood
      fairly committed to the adventure, he resigned himself to circumstances
      with his customary facility. He too lit a cigar, and took a chair by the
      fire, and looked about him with an impenetrable composure worthy of Rufus
      Dingwell himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room bore no sort of resemblance to a boudoir. A faded old turkey
      carpet was spread on the floor. The common mahogany table had no covering;
      the chintz on the chairs was of a truly venerable age. Some of the
      furniture made the place look like a room occupied by a man. Dumb-bells
      and clubs of the sort used in athletic exercises hung over the bare
      mantelpiece; a large ugly oaken structure with closed doors, something
      between a cabinet and a wardrobe, rose on one side to the ceiling; a
      turning lathe stood against the opposite wall. Above the lathe were hung
      in a row four prints, in dingy old frames of black wood, which especially
      attracted the attention of Amelius. Mostly foreign prints, they were all
      discoloured by time, and they all strangely represented different aspects
      of the same subject&mdash;infants parted from their parents by desertion
      or robbery. The young Moses was there, in his ark of bulrushes, on the
      river bank. Good St. Francis appeared next, roaming the streets, and
      rescuing forsaken children in the wintry night. A third print showed the
      foundling hospital of old Paris, with the turning cage in the wall, and
      the bell to ring when the infant was placed in it. The next and last
      subject was the stealing of a child from the lap of its slumbering nurse
      by a gipsy woman. These sadly suggestive subjects were the only ornaments
      on the walls. No traces of books or music were visible; no needlework of
      any sort was to be seen; no elegant trifles; no china or flowers or
      delicate lacework or sparkling jewelry&mdash;nothing, absolutely nothing,
      suggestive of a woman&rsquo;s presence appeared in any part of Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got several things to say to you,&rdquo; she began; &ldquo;but one thing must
      be settled first. Give me your sacred word of honour that you will not
      repeat to any mortal creature what I am going to tell you now.&rdquo; She
      reclined in her chair, and drew in a mouthful of smoke and puffed it out
      again, and waited for his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young and unsuspicious as he was, this unscrupulous method of taking his
      confidence by storm startled Amelius. His natural tact and good sense told
      him plainly that Mrs. Farnaby was asking too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I must remind you that you are
      going to tell me your secrets, without any wish to intrude on them on my
      part&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him there. &ldquo;What does that matter?&rdquo; she asked coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius was obstinate; he went on with what he had to say. &ldquo;I should like
      to know,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;that I am doing no wrong to anybody, before I
      give you my promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be doing a kindness to a miserable creature,&rdquo; she answered, as
      quietly as ever; &ldquo;and you will be doing no wrong to yourself or to anybody
      else, if you promise. That is all I can say. Your cigar is out. Take a
      light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius took a light, with the dog-like docility of a man in a state of
      blank amazement. She waited, watching him composedly until his cigar was
      in working order again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Will you promise now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius gave her his promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your sacred word of honour?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius repeated the formula. She reclined in her chair once more. &ldquo;I want
      to speak to you as if I was speaking to an old friend,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I
      suppose I may call you Amelius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Amelius, I must tell you first that I committed a sin, many long
      years ago. I have suffered the punishment; I am suffering it still. Ever
      since I was a young woman, I have had a heavy burden of misery on my
      heart. I am not reconciled to it, I cannot submit to it, yet. I never
      shall be reconciled to it, I never shall submit to it, if I live to be a
      hundred. Do you wish me to enter into particulars? or will you have mercy
      on me, and be satisfied with what I have told you so far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not said entreatingly, or tenderly, or humbly: she spoke with a
      savage self-contained resignation in her manner and in her voice. Amelius
      forgot his cigar again&mdash;and again she reminded him of it. He answered
      her as his own generous impulsive temperament urged him; he said, &ldquo;Tell me
      nothing that causes you a moment&rsquo;s pain; tell me only how I can help you.&rdquo;
       She handed him the box of matches; she said, &ldquo;Your cigar is out again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid down his cigar. In his brief span of life he had seen no human
      misery that expressed itself in this way. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I
      won&rsquo;t smoke just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her cigar aside like Amelius, and crossed her arms over her
      bosom, and looked at him, with the first softening gleam of tenderness
      that he had seen in her face. &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;yours will be a sad
      life&mdash;I pity you. The world will wound that sensitive heart of yours;
      the world will trample on that generous nature. One of these days,
      perhaps, you will be a wretch like me. No more of that. Get up; I have
      something to show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rising herself, she led the way to the large oaken press, and took her
      bunch of keys out of her pocket again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About this old sorrow of mine,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;Do me justice, Amelius, at
      the outset. I haven&rsquo;t treated it as some women treat their sorrows&mdash;I
      haven&rsquo;t nursed it and petted it and made the most of it to myself and to
      others. No! I have tried every means of relief, every possible pursuit
      that could occupy my mind. One example of what I say will do as well as a
      hundred. See it for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put the key in the lock. It resisted her first efforts to open it.
      With a contemptuous burst of impatience and a sudden exertion of her rare
      strength, she tore open the two doors of the press. Behind the door on the
      left appeared a row of open shelves. The opposite compartment, behind the
      door on the right, was filled by drawers with brass handles. She shut the
      left door; angrily banging it to, as if the opening of it had disclosed
      something which she did not wish to be seen. By the merest chance, Amelius
      had looked that way first. In the one instant in which it was possible to
      see anything, he had noticed, carefully laid out on one of the shelves, a
      baby&rsquo;s long linen frock and cap, turned yellow by the lapse of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-told story of the past was more than half told now. The treasured
      relics of the infant threw their little glimmer of light on the motive
      which had chosen the subjects of the prints on the wall. A child deserted
      and lost! A child who, by bare possibility, might be living still!
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned towards Amelius suddenly, &ldquo;There is nothing to interest you on
      <i>that</i> side,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Look at the drawers here; open them for
      yourself.&rdquo; She drew back as she spoke, and pointed to the uppermost of the
      row of drawers. A narrow slip of paper was pasted on it, bearing this
      inscription:&mdash;<i>&ldquo;Dead Consolations.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius opened the drawer; it was full of books. &ldquo;Look at them,&rdquo; she said.
      Amelius, obeying her, discovered dictionaries, grammars, exercises, poems,
      novels, and histories&mdash;all in the German language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A foreign language tried as a relief,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farnaby, speaking
      quietly behind him. &ldquo;Month after month of hard study&mdash;all forgotten
      now. The old sorrow came back in spite of it. A dead consolation! Open the
      next drawer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next drawer revealed water-colours and drawing materials huddled
      together in a corner, and a heap of poor little conventional landscapes
      filling up the rest of the space. As works of art, they were wretched in
      the last degree; monuments of industry and application miserably and
      completely thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no talent for that pursuit, as you see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farnaby. &ldquo;But I
      persevered with it, week after week, month after month. I thought to
      myself, &lsquo;I hate it so, it costs me such dreadful trouble, it so worries
      and persecutes and humiliates me, that <i>this</i> surely must keep my
      mind occupied and my thoughts away from myself!&rsquo; No; the old sorrow stared
      me in the face again on the paper that I was spoiling, through the colours
      that I couldn&rsquo;t learn to use. Another dead consolation! Shut it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She herself opened a third and a fourth drawer. In one there appeared a
      copy of Euclid, and a slate with the problems still traced on it; the
      other contained a microscope, and the treatises relating to its use.
      &ldquo;Always the same effort,&rdquo; she said, shutting the door of the press as she
      spoke; &ldquo;and always the same result. You have had enough of it, and so have
      I.&rdquo; She turned, and pointed to the lathe in the corner, and to the clubs
      and dumb-bells over the mantelpiece. &ldquo;I can look at <i>them</i>
      patiently,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;they give me bodily relief. I work at the lathe
      till my back aches; I swing the clubs till I&rsquo;m ready to drop with fatigue.
      And then I lie down on the rug there, and sleep it off, and forget myself
      for an hour or two. Come back to the fire again. You have seen my dead
      consolations; you must hear about my living consolation next. In justice
      to Mr. Farnaby&mdash;ah, how I hate him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke those last vehement words to herself, but with such intense
      bitterness of contempt that the tones were quite loud enough to be heard.
      Amelius looked furtively towards the door. Was there no hope that Regina
      and her friend might return and interrupt them? After what he had seen and
      heard, could <i>he</i> hope to console Mrs. Farnaby? He could only wonder
      what object she could possibly have in view in taking him into her
      confidence. &ldquo;Am I always to be in a mess with women?&rdquo; he thought to
      himself. &ldquo;First poor Mellicent, and now this one. What next?&rdquo; He lit his
      cigar again. The brotherhood of smokers, and they alone, will understand
      what a refuge it was to him at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a light,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farnaby, recalled to the remembrance of her
      own cigar. &ldquo;I want to know one thing before I go on. Amelius, I watched
      those bright eyes of yours at luncheon-time. Did they tell me the truth?
      You&rsquo;re not in love with my niece, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius took his cigar out of his mouth, and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with it boldly!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius let it out, to a certain extent. &ldquo;I admire her very much,&rdquo; he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby remarked, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know her as well as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The disdainful indifference of her tone irritated Amelius. He was still
      young enough to believe in the existence of gratitude; and Mrs. Farnaby
      had spoken ungratefully. Besides, he was fond enough of Regina already to
      feel offended when she was referred to slightingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised to hear what you say of her,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;She is quite
      devoted to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farnaby, carelessly. &ldquo;She is devoted to me, of course&mdash;she
      is the living consolation I told you of just now. That was Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s
      notion in adopting her. Mr. Farnaby thought to himself, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a
      ready-made daughter for my wife&mdash;that&rsquo;s all this tiresome woman wants
      to comfort her: now we shall do.&rsquo; Do you know what I call that? I call it
      reasoning like an idiot. A man may be very clever at his business&mdash;and
      may be a contemptible fool in other respects. Another woman&rsquo;s child a
      consolation to <i>me!</i> Pah! it makes me sick to think of it. I have one
      merit, Amelius, I don&rsquo;t cant. It&rsquo;s my duty to take care of my sister&rsquo;s
      child; and I do my duty willingly. Regina&rsquo;s a good sort of creature&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t dispute it. But she&rsquo;s like all those tall darkish women: there&rsquo;s no
      backbone in her, no dash; a kind, feeble, goody-goody, sugarish
      disposition; and a deal of quiet obstinacy at the bottom of it, I can tell
      you. Oh yes, I do her justice; I don&rsquo;t deny that she&rsquo;s devoted to me, as
      you say. But I am making a clean breast of it now. And you ought to know,
      and you shall know, that Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s living consolation is no more a
      consolation to me than the things you have seen in the drawers. There! now
      we&rsquo;ve done with Regina. No: there&rsquo;s one thing more to be cleared up. When
      you say you admire her, what do you mean? Do you mean to marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once in his life Amelius stood on his dignity. &ldquo;I have too much
      respect for the young lady to answer your question,&rdquo; he said loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if you do,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby proceeded, &ldquo;I mean to put every
      possible obstacle in your way. In short, I mean to prevent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This plain declaration staggered Amelius. He confessed the truth by
      implication in one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a little, and recover your temper,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. They sat, on either side of the fireplace, and eyed
      each other attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now are you ready?&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby resumed. &ldquo;Here is my reason. If you
      marry Regina, or marry anybody, you will settle down somewhere, and lead a
      dull life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Amelius; &ldquo;and why not, if I like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I want you to remain a roving bachelor; here today and gone
      tomorrow&mdash;travelling all over the world, and seeing everything and
      everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good will that do to <i>you,</i> Mrs. Farnaby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose from her own side of the fireplace, crossed to the side on which
      Amelius was sitting, and, standing before him, placed her hands heavily on
      his shoulders. Her eyes grew radiant with a sudden interest and animation
      as they looked down on him, riveted on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am still waiting, my friend, for the living consolation that may yet
      come to me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And, hear this, Amelius! After all the years that
      have passed, you may be the man who brings it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the momentary silence that followed, they heard a double knock at the
      house-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regina!&rdquo; said Mrs. Farnaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the name passed her lips, she sprang to the door of the room, and
      turned the key in the lock.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Amelius rose impulsively from his chair.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby turned at the same moment, and signed to him to resume his
      seat. &ldquo;You have given me your promise,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;All I ask of you
      is to be silent.&rdquo; She softly drew the key out of the door, and showed it
      to him. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get out,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;unless you take the key from me by
      force!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Amelius might think of the situation in which he now found
      himself, the one thing that he could honourably do was to say nothing, and
      submit to it. He remained quietly by the fire. No imaginable consideration
      (he mentally resolved) should induce him to consent to a second
      confidential interview in Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant opened the house-door. Regina&rsquo;s voice was heard in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has my aunt come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard nothing of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Goldenheart been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very extraordinary! What can have become of them, Cecilia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the other lady was heard in answer. &ldquo;We have probably missed
      them, on leaving the concert room. Don&rsquo;t alarm yourself, Regina. I must go
      back, under any circumstances; the carriage will be waiting for me. If I
      see anything of your aunt, I will say that you are expecting her at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Cecilia! (Thomas, you needn&rsquo;t wait.) Is it really true that
      you don&rsquo;t like Mr. Goldenheart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! has it come to that, already? I&rsquo;ll try to like him, Regina. Goodbye
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The closing of the street door told that the ladies had separated. The
      sound was followed, in another moment, by the opening and closing of the
      dining-room door. Mrs. Farnaby returned to her chair at the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regina has gone into the dining-room to wait for us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I see
      you don&rsquo;t like your position here; and I won&rsquo;t keep you more than a few
      minutes longer. You are of course at a loss to understand what I was
      saying to you, when the knock at the door interrupted us. Sit down again
      for five minutes; it fidgets me to see you standing there, looking at your
      boots. I told you I had one consolation still possibly left. Judge for
      yourself what the hope of it is to me, when I own to you that I should
      long since have put an end to my life, without it. Don&rsquo;t think I am
      talking nonsense; I mean what I say. It is one of my misfortunes that I
      have no religious scruples to restrain me. There was a time when I
      believed that religion might comfort me. I once opened my heart to a
      clergyman&mdash;a worthy person, who did his best to help me. All useless!
      My heart was too hard, I suppose. It doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;except to give
      you one more proof that I am thoroughly in earnest. Patience! patience! I
      am coming to the point. I asked you some odd questions, on the day when
      you first dined here? You have forgotten all about them, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember them perfectly well,&rdquo; Amelius answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember them? That looks as if you had thought about them
      afterwards. Come! tell me plainly what you did think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius told her plainly. She became more and more interested, more and
      more excited, as he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right!&rdquo; she exclaimed, starting to her feet and walking swiftly
      backwards and forwards in the room. &ldquo;There <i>is</i> a lost girl whom I
      want to find; and she is between sixteen and seventeen years old, as you
      thought. Mind! I have no reason&mdash;not the shadow of a reason&mdash;for
      believing that she is still a living creature. I have only my own stupid
      obstinate conviction; rooted here,&rdquo; she pressed both hands fiercely on her
      heart, &ldquo;so that nothing can tear it out of me! I have lived in that belief&mdash;Oh,
      don&rsquo;t ask me how long! it is so far, so miserably far, to look back!&rdquo; She
      stopped in the middle of the room. Her breath came and went in quick heavy
      gasps; the first tears that had softened the hard wretchedness in her eyes
      rose in them now, and transfigured them with the divine beauty of maternal
      love. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t distress you,&rdquo; she said, stamping on the floor, as she
      struggled with the hysterical passion that was raging in her. &ldquo;Give me a
      minute, and I&rsquo;ll force it down again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped into a chair, threw her arms heavily on the table, and laid
      her head on them. Amelius thought of the child&rsquo;s frock and cap hidden in
      the cabinet. All that was manly and noble in his nature felt for the
      unhappy woman, whose secret was dimly revealed to him now. The little
      selfish sense of annoyance at the awkward situation in which she had
      placed him, vanished to return no more. He approached her, and put his
      hand gently on her shoulder. &ldquo;I am truly sorry for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell me
      how I can help you, and I will do it with all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really mean that?&rdquo; She roughly dashed the tears from her eyes, and
      rose as she put the question. Holding him with one hand, she parted the
      hair back from his forehead with the other. &ldquo;I must see your whole face,&rdquo;
       she said&mdash;&ldquo;your face will tell me. Yes: you do mean it. The world
      hasn&rsquo;t spoilt you, yet. Do you believe in dreams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked at her, startled by the sudden transition. She deliberately
      repeated her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you seriously,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;do you believe in dreams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius answered seriously, on his side, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t honestly say that I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;like me. I don&rsquo;t believe in dreams, either&mdash;I
      wish I did! But it&rsquo;s not in me to believe in superstitions; I&rsquo;m too hard&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;m sorry for it. I have seen people who were comforted by their
      superstitions; happy people, possessed of faith. Don&rsquo;t you even believe
      that dreams are sometimes fulfilled by chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody can deny that,&rdquo; Amelius replied; &ldquo;the instances of it are too
      many. But for one dream fulfilled by a coincidence, there are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred at least that are <i>not</i> fulfilled,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby
      interposed. &ldquo;Very well. I calculate on that. See how little hope can live
      on! There is just the barest possibility that what I dreamed of you the
      other night may come to pass. It&rsquo;s a poor chance; but it has encouraged me
      to take you into my confidence, and ask you to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This strange confession&mdash;this sad revelation of despair still
      unconsciously deceiving itself under the disguise of hope&mdash;only
      strengthened the compassionate sympathy which Amelius already felt for
      her. &ldquo;What did you dream about me?&rdquo; he asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to tell,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I was in a room that was quite
      strange to me; and the door opened, and you came in leading a young girl
      by the hand. You said, &lsquo;Be happy at last; here she is.&rsquo; My heart knew her
      instantly, though my eyes had never seen her since the first days of her
      life. And I woke myself, crying for joy. Wait! it&rsquo;s not all told yet. I
      went to sleep again, and dreamed it again, and woke, and lay awake for
      awhile, and slept once more, and dreamed it for the third time. Ah, if I
      could only feel some people&rsquo;s confidence in three times! No; it produced
      an impression on me&mdash;and that was all. I got as far as thinking to
      myself, there is just a chance; I haven&rsquo;t a creature in the world to help
      me; I may as well speak to him. O, you needn&rsquo;t remind me that there is a
      rational explanation of my dream. I have read it all up, in the
      Encyclopaedia in the library. One of the ideas of wise men is that we
      think of something, consciously or unconsciously, in the daytime, and then
      reproduce it in a dream. That&rsquo;s my case, I daresay. When you were first
      introduced to me, and when I heard where you had been brought up, I
      thought directly that <i>she</i> might have been one among the many
      forlorn creatures who had drifted to your Community, and that I might find
      her through you. Say that thought went to my bed with me&mdash;and we have
      the explanation of my dream. Never mind! There is my one poor chance in a
      hundred still left. You will remember me, Amelius, if you <i>should</i>
      meet with her, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The implied confession of her own intractable character, without religious
      faith to ennoble it, without even imagination to refine it&mdash;the
      unconscious disclosure of the one tender and loving instinct in her nature
      still piteously struggling for existence, with no sympathy to sustain it,
      with no light to guide it&mdash;would have touched the heart of any man
      not incurably depraved. Amelius spoke with the fervour of his young
      enthusiasm. &ldquo;I would go to the uttermost ends of the earth, if I thought I
      could do you any good. But, oh, it sounds so hopeless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that! You are free, you have money, you will travel about in
      the world and amuse yourself. In a week you will see more than
      stay-at-home people see in a year. How do we know what the future has in
      store for us? I have my own idea. She may be lost in the labyrinth of
      London, or she may be hundreds of thousands of miles away. Amuse yourself,
      Amelius&mdash;amuse yourself. Tomorrow or ten years hence, you might meet
      with her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In sheer mercy to the poor creature, Amelius refused to encourage her
      delusion. &ldquo;Even supposing such a thing could happen,&rdquo; he objected, &ldquo;how am
      I to know the lost girl? You can&rsquo;t describe her to me; you have not seen
      her since she was a child. Do you know anything of what happened at the
      time&mdash;I mean at the time when she was lost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never felt a suspicion of how it happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face changed: she frowned as she looked at him. &ldquo;Not till weeks and
      months had passed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not till it was too late. I was ill at the
      time. When my mind got clear again, I began to suspect one particular
      person&mdash;little by little, you know; noticing trifles, and thinking
      about them afterwards.&rdquo; She stopped, evidently restraining herself on the
      point of saying more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius tried to lead her on. &ldquo;Did you suspect the person&mdash;?&rdquo; he
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected him of casting the child helpless on the world!&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby
      interposed, with a sudden burst of fury. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me any more about it,
      or I shall break out and shock you!&rdquo; She clenched her fists as she said
      the words. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s well for that man,&rdquo; she muttered between her teeth, &ldquo;that
      I have never got beyond suspecting, and never found out the truth! Why did
      you turn my mind that way? You shouldn&rsquo;t have done it. Help me back again
      to what we were saying a minute ago. You made some objection; you said&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said,&rdquo; Amelius reminded her, &ldquo;that, even if I did meet with the missing
      girl, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly know it. And I must say more than that&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t see how you yourself could be sure of recognizing her, if she stood
      before you at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke very gently, fearing to irritate her. She showed no sign of
      irritation&mdash;she looked at him, and listened to him, attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you setting a trap for me?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried, before
      Amelius could answer, &ldquo;I am not mean enough to distrust you&mdash;I forgot
      myself. You have innocently said something that rankles in my mind. I
      can&rsquo;t leave it where you have left it; I don&rsquo;t like to be told that I
      shouldn&rsquo;t recognize her. Give me time to think. I must clear this up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She consulted her own thoughts, keeping her eyes fixed on Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to speak plainly,&rdquo; she announced, with a sudden appearance of
      resolution. &ldquo;Listen to this. When I banged to the door of that big
      cupboard of mine, it was because I didn&rsquo;t want you to see something on the
      shelves. Did you see anything in spite of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was not an easy one to answer. Amelius hesitated. Mrs.
      Farnaby insisted on a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see anything?&rdquo; she reiterated
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius owned that he had seen something.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away from him, and looked into the fire. Her firm full tones
      sank so low, when she spoke next, that he could barely hear them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it something belonging to a child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it a baby&rsquo;s frock and cap? Answer me. We have gone too far to go
      back. I don&rsquo;t want apologies or explanations&mdash;I want, Yes or No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an interval of silence. She never moved; she still looked into
      fire&mdash;looked, as if all her past life was pictured there in the
      burning coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you despise me?&rdquo; she asked at last, very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As God hears me, I am only sorry for you!&rdquo; Amelius answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another woman would have melted into tears. This woman still looked into
      the fire&mdash;and that was all. &ldquo;What a good fellow!&rdquo; she said to
      herself, &ldquo;what a good fellow he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another pause. She turned towards him again as abruptly as she
      had turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped to spare you, and to spare myself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If the
      miserable truth has come out, it is through no curiosity of yours, and
      (God knows!) against every wish of mine. I don&rsquo;t know if you really felt
      like a friend towards me before&mdash;you must be my friend now. Don&rsquo;t
      speak! I know I can trust you. One last word, Amelius, about my lost
      child. You doubt whether I should recognize her, if she stood before me
      now. That might be quite true, if I had only my own poor hopes and
      anxieties to guide me. But I have something else to guide me&mdash;and,
      after what has passed between us, you may as well know what it is: it
      might even, by accident, guide you. Don&rsquo;t alarm yourself; it&rsquo;s nothing
      distressing this time. How can I explain it?&rdquo; she went on; pausing, and
      speaking in some perplexity to herself. &ldquo;It would be easier to show it&mdash;and
      why not?&rdquo; She addressed herself to Amelius once more. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a strange
      creature,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;First, I worry you about my own affairs&mdash;then
      I puzzle you&mdash;then I make you sorry for me&mdash;and now (would you
      think it?) I am going to amuse you! Amelius, are you an admirer of pretty
      feet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius had heard of men (in books) who had found reason to doubt whether
      their own ears were not deceiving them. For the first time, he began to
      understand those men, and to sympathize with them. He admitted, in a
      certain bewildered way, that he was an admirer of pretty feet&mdash;and
      waited for what was to come next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a woman has a pretty hand,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby proceeded; &ldquo;she is ready
      enough to show it. When she goes out to a ball, she favours you with a
      view of her bosom, and a part of her back. Now tell me! If there is no
      impropriety in a naked bosom&mdash;where is the impropriety in a naked
      foot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius agreed, like a man in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, indeed!&rdquo; he remarked&mdash;and waited again for what was to come
      next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out of the window,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farnaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius obeyed. The window had been opened for a few inches at the top, no
      doubt to ventilate the room. The dull view of the courtyard was varied by
      the stables at the farther end, and by the kitchen skylight rising in the
      middle of the open space. As Amelius looked out, he observed that some
      person at that moment in the kitchen required apparently a large supply of
      fresh air. The swinging window, on the side of the skylight which was
      nearest to him, was invisibly and noiselessly pulled open from below; the
      similar window, on the other side, being already wide open also. Judging
      by appearance, the inhabitants of the kitchen possessed a merit which is
      exceedingly rare among domestic servants&mdash;they understood the laws of
      ventilation, and appreciated the blessing of fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farnaby. &ldquo;You can turn round now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius turned. Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s boots and stockings were on the hearthrug,
      and one of Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s feet was placed, ready for inspection, on the
      chair which he had just left. &ldquo;Look at my right foot first,&rdquo; she said,
      speaking gravely and composedly in her ordinary tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well worth looking at&mdash;a foot equally beautiful in form and in
      colour: the instep arched and high, the ankle at once delicate and strong,
      the toes tinged with rose-colour at the tips. In brief, it was a foot to
      be photographed, to be cast in plaster, to be fondled and kissed. Amelius
      attempted to express his admiration, but was not allowed to get beyond the
      first two or three words. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby explained, &ldquo;this is not
      vanity&mdash;simply information. You have seen my right foot; and you have
      noticed that there is nothing the matter with it. Very well. Now look at
      my left foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her left foot up on the chair. &ldquo;Look between the third toe and the
      fourth,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following his instructions, Amelius discovered that the beauty of the foot
      was spoilt, in this case, by a singular defect. The two toes were bound
      together by a flexible web, or membrane, which held them to each other as
      high as the insertion of the nail on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wonder,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby asked, &ldquo;why I show you the fault in my foot?
      Amelius! my poor darling was born with my deformity&mdash;and I want you
      to know exactly what it is, because neither you nor I can say what reason
      for remembering it there may not be in the future.&rdquo; She stopped, as if to
      give him an opportunity of speaking. A man shallow and flippant by nature
      might have seen the disclosure in a grotesque aspect. Amelius was sad and
      silent. &ldquo;I like you better and better,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;You are not like the
      common run of men. Nine out of ten of them would have turned what I have
      just told you into a joke&mdash;nine out of ten would have said, &lsquo;Am I to
      ask every girl I meet to show me her left foot?&rsquo; You are above that; you
      understand me. Have I no means of recognizing my own child, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and took her foot off the chair&mdash;then, after a moment&rsquo;s
      thought, she pointed to it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep this as strictly secret as you keep everything else,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In
      the past days, when I used to employ people privately to help me to find
      her, it was my only defence against being imposed upon. Rogues and
      vagabonds thought of other marks and signs&mdash;but not one of them could
      guess at such a mark as that. Have you got your pocket-book, Amelius? In
      case we are separated at some later time, I want to write the name and
      address in it of a person whom we can trust. I persist, you see, in
      providing for the future. There&rsquo;s the one chance in a hundred that my
      dream may come true&mdash;and you have so many years before you, and so
      many girls to meet with in that time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She handed back the pocket-book, which Amelius had given to her, after
      having inscribed a man&rsquo;s name and address on one of the blank leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was my father&rsquo;s lawyer,&rdquo; she explained; &ldquo;and he and his son are both
      men to be trusted. Suppose I am ill, for instance&mdash;no, that&rsquo;s absurd;
      I never had a day&rsquo;s illness in my life. Suppose I am dead (killed perhaps
      by some accident, or perhaps by my own hand), the lawyers have my written
      instructions, in the case of my child being found. Then again&mdash;I am
      such an unaccountable woman&mdash;I may go away somewhere, all by myself.
      Never mind! The lawyers shall have my address, and my positive orders
      (though they keep it a secret from all the world besides) to tell it to
      you. I don&rsquo;t ask your pardon, Amelius, for troubling you. The chances are
      so terribly against me; it is all but impossible that I shall ever see you&mdash;as
      I saw you in my dream&mdash;coming into the room, leading my girl by the
      hand. Odd, isn&rsquo;t it? This is how I veer about between hope and despair.
      Well, it may amuse you to remember it, one of these days. Years hence,
      when I am at rest in mother earth, and when you are a middle aged married
      man, you may tell your wife how strangely you once became the forlorn hope
      of the most wretched woman that ever lived&mdash;and you may say to each
      other, as you sit by your snug fireside, &lsquo;Perhaps that poor lost daughter
      is still living somewhere, and wondering who her mother was.&rsquo; No! I won&rsquo;t
      let you see the tears in my eyes again&mdash;I&rsquo;ll let you go at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the way to the door&mdash;a creature to be pitied, if ever there
      was a pitiable creature yet: a woman whose whole nature was maternal, who
      was nothing if not a mother; and who had lived through sixteen years of
      barren life, in the hopeless anticipation of recovering her lost child!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye, and thank you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to be left by myself, my dear,
      with that little frock and cap which you found out in spite of me. Go, and
      tell my niece it&rsquo;s all right&mdash;and don&rsquo;t be stupid enough to fall in
      love with a girl who has no love to give you in return.&rdquo; She pushed
      Amelius into the hall. &ldquo;Here he is, Regina!&rdquo; she called out; &ldquo;I have done
      with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Amelius could speak, she had shut herself into her room. He
      advanced along the hall, and met Regina at the door of the dining-room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The young lady spoke first.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Goldenheart,&rdquo; she said, with the coldest possible politeness,
      &ldquo;perhaps you will be good enough to explain what this means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned back into the dining-room. Amelius followed her in silence.
      &ldquo;Here I am, in another scrape with a woman!&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;Are
      men in general as unlucky as I am, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t close the door,&rdquo; said Regina maliciously. &ldquo;Everybody in the
      house is welcome to hear what <i>I</i> have to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius made a mistake at the outset&mdash;he tried what a little humility
      would do to help him. There is probably no instance on record in which
      humility on the part of a man has ever really found its way to the
      indulgence of an irritated woman. The best and the worst of them alike
      have at least one virtue in common&mdash;they secretly despise a man who
      is not bold enough to defend himself when they are angry with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I have not offended you?&rdquo; Amelius ventured to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tossed her head contemptuously. &ldquo;Oh dear, no! I am not offended. Only
      a little surprised at your being so very ready to oblige my aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the short experience of her which had fallen to the lot of Amelius, she
      had never looked so charmingly as she looked now. The nervous irritability
      under which she was suffering brightened her face with the animation which
      was wanting in it at ordinary times. Her soft brown eyes sparkled; her
      smooth dusky cheeks glowed with a warm red flush; her tall supple figure
      asserted its full dignity, robed in a superb dress of silken purple and
      black lace, which set off her personal attractions to the utmost
      advantage. She not only roused the admiration of Amelius&mdash;she
      unconsciously gave him back the self-possession which he had, for the
      moment, completely lost. He was man enough to feel the humiliation of
      being despised by the one woman in the world whose love he longed to win;
      and he answered with a sudden firmness of tone and look that startled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better speak more plainly still, Miss Regina,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You may
      as well blame me at once for the misfortune of being a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew back a step. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I owe no forbearance to a woman who asks a favour of me?&rdquo; Amelius went
      on. &ldquo;If a man had asked me to steal into the house on tiptoe, I should
      have said&mdash;well! I should have said something I had better not
      repeat. If a man had stood between me and the door when you came back, I
      should have taken him by the collar and pulled him out of my way. Could I
      do that, if you please, with Mrs. Farnaby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina saw the weak point of this defence with a woman&rsquo;s quickness of
      perception. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t offer any opinion,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;especially when you
      lay all the blame on my aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius opened his lips to protest&mdash;and thought better of it. He
      wisely went straight on with what he had still to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will let me finish,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;you will understand me a little
      better than that. Whatever blame there may be, Miss Regina, I am quite
      ready to take on myself. I merely wanted to remind you that I was put in
      an awkward position, and that I couldn&rsquo;t civilly find a way out of it. As
      for your aunt, I will only say this: I know of hardly any sacrifice that I
      would not submit to, if I could be of the smallest service to her. After
      what I heard, while I was in her room&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina interrupted him at that point. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s a secret between
      you?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s a secret,&rdquo; Amelius proceeded, &ldquo;as you say. But one thing I may
      tell you, without breaking my promise. Mrs. Farnaby has&mdash;well! has
      filled me with kindly feeling towards her. She has a claim, poor soul, to
      my truest sympathy. And I shall remember her claim. And I shall be
      faithful to what I feel towards her as long as I live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not very elegantly expressed; but the tone was the tone of true
      feeling in his voice trembled, his colour rose. He stood before her,
      speaking with perfect simplicity straight from his heart&mdash;and the
      woman&rsquo;s heart felt it instantly. This was the man whose ridicule she had
      dreaded, if her aunt&rsquo;s rash confidence struck him in an absurd light! She
      sat down in silence, with a grave sad face, reproaching herself for the
      wrong which her too ready distrust had inflicted on him; longing to ask
      his pardon, and yet hesitating to say the simple words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached her chair, and, placing his hand on the back of it, said
      gently, &ldquo;do you think a little better of me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had taken off her gloves: she silently folded and refolded them in her
      lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your good opinion is very precious to me,&rdquo; Amelius pleaded, bending a
      little nearer to her. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how sorry I should be&mdash;&rdquo; He
      stopped, and put it more strongly. &ldquo;I shall never have courage enough to
      enter the house again, if I have made you think meanly of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman who cared nothing for him would have easily answered this. The
      calm heart of Regina began to flutter: something warned her not to trust
      herself to speak. Little as he suspected it, Amelius had troubled the
      tranquil temperament of this woman. He had found his way to those secret
      reserves of tenderness&mdash;placid and deep&mdash;of which she was hardly
      conscious herself, until his influence had enlightened her. She was afraid
      to look up at him; her eyes would have told him the truth. She lifted her
      long, finely shaped, dusky hand, and offered it to him as the best answer
      that she could make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius took it, looked at it, and ventured on his first familiarity with
      her&mdash;he kissed it. She only said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; very faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Queen would let me kiss her hand if I went to Court,&rdquo; Amelius
      reminded her, with a pleasant inner conviction of his wonderful readiness
      at finding an excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled in spite of herself. &ldquo;Would the Queen let you hold it?&rdquo; she
      asked, gently releasing her hand, and looking at him as she drew it away.
      The peace was made without another word of explanation. Amelius took a
      chair at her side. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite happy now you have forgiven me,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I admire you&mdash;and how anxious I am to please you,
      if I only knew how!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew his chair a little nearer; his eyes told her plainly that his
      language would soon become warmer still, if she gave him the smallest
      encouragement. This was one reason for changing the subject. But there was
      another reason, more cogent still. Her first painful sense of having
      treated him unjustly had ceased to make itself keenly felt; the lower
      emotions had their opportunity of asserting themselves. Curiosity,
      irresistible curiosity, took possession of her mind, and urged her to
      penetrate the mystery of the interview between Amelius and her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you think me very indiscreet,&rdquo; she began slyly, &ldquo;if I made a little
      confession to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius was only too eager to hear the confession: it would pave the way
      for something of the same sort on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand my aunt making the heat in the concert-room a pretence for
      taking you away with her,&rdquo; Regina proceeded; &ldquo;but what astonishes me is
      that she should have admitted you to her confidence after so short an
      acquaintance. You are still&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;you are still a
      new friend of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will it be before I become an old friend?&rdquo; Amelius asked. &ldquo;I
      mean,&rdquo; he added, with artful emphasis, &ldquo;an old friend of <i>yours?&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Confused by the question, Regina passed it over without notice. &ldquo;I am Mrs.
      Farnaby&rsquo;s adopted daughter,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;I have been with her since I
      was a little girl&mdash;and yet she has never told me any of her secrets.
      Pray don&rsquo;t suppose that I am tempting you to break faith with my aunt! I
      am quite incapable of such conduct as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius saw his way to a thoroughly commonplace compliment which possessed
      the charm of complete novelty so far as his experience was concerned. He
      would actually have told her that she was incapable of doing anything
      which was not perfectly becoming to a charming person, if she had only
      given him time! She was too eager in the pursuit of her own object to give
      him time. &ldquo;I <i>should</i> like to know,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;whether my aunt
      has been influenced in any way by a dream that she had about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius started. &ldquo;Has she told you of her dream?&rdquo; he asked, with some
      appearance of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina blushed and hesitated, &ldquo;My room is next to my aunt&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she
      explained. &ldquo;We keep the door between us open. I am often in and out when
      she is disturbed in her sleep. She was talking in her sleep, and I heard
      your name&mdash;nothing more. Perhaps I ought not to have mentioned it?
      Perhaps I ought not to expect you to answer me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no harm in my answering you,&rdquo; said Amelius. &ldquo;The dream really
      had something to do with her trusting me. You may not think quite so
      unfavourably of her conduct now you know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what I think,&rdquo; Regina replied constrainedly. &ldquo;If my
      aunt&rsquo;s secrets have interested you&mdash;what right have I to object? I am
      sure I shall say nothing. Though I am not in my aunt&rsquo;s confidence, nor in
      your confidence, you will find I can keep a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She folded up her gloves for the twentieth time at least, and gave Amelius
      his opportunity of retiring by rising from her chair. He made a last
      effort to recover the ground that he had lost, without betraying Mrs.
      Farnaby&rsquo;s trust in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you can keep a secret,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I should like to give you one
      of my secrets to keep&mdash;only I mustn&rsquo;t take the liberty, I suppose,
      just yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She new perfectly well what he wanted to say. Her heart began to quicken
      its beat; she was at a loss how to answer. After an awkward silence, she
      made an attempt to dismiss him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me detain you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if
      you have any engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius silently looked round him for his hat. On a table behind him a
      monthly magazine lay open, exhibiting one of those melancholy modern
      &ldquo;illustrations&rdquo; which present the English art of our day in its laziest
      and lowest state of degradation. A vacuous young giant, in flowing
      trousers, stood in a garden, and stared at a plump young giantess with
      enormous eyes and rotund hips, vacantly boring holes in the grass with the
      point of her parasol. Perfectly incapable of explaining itself, this
      imbecile production put its trust in the printer, whose charitable types
      helped it, at the bottom of the page, with the title of &ldquo;Love at First
      Sight.&rdquo; On those remarkable words Amelius seized, with the desperation of
      the drowning man, catching at the proverbial straw. They offered him a
      chance of pleading his cause, this time, with a happy indirectness of
      allusion at which not even a young lady&rsquo;s susceptibility could take
      offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in that?&rdquo; he said, pointing to the illustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina declined to understand him. &ldquo;In what?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In love at first sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be speaking with inexcusable rudeness to say plainly that she
      told him a lie. Let the milder form of expression be, that she modestly
      concealed the truth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I</i> do,&rdquo; Amelius remarked smartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She persisted in looking at the illustration. Was there an infection of
      imbecility in that fatal work? She was too simple to understand him, even
      yet! &ldquo;You do&mdash;what?&rdquo; she inquired innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what love at first sight is,&rdquo; Amelius burst out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina turned over the leaves of the magazine. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have
      read the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t read the story,&rdquo; Amelius answered. &ldquo;I know what I felt myself&mdash;on
      being introduced to a young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with a sly smile. &ldquo;A young lady in America?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In England, Miss Regina.&rdquo; He tried to take her hand&mdash;but she kept it
      out of his reach. &ldquo;In London,&rdquo; he went on, drifting back into his
      customary plainness of speech. &ldquo;In this very street,&rdquo; he resumed, seizing
      her hand before she was aware of him. Too much bewildered to know what
      else to do, Regina took refuge desperately in shaking hands with him.
      &ldquo;Goodbye, Mr. Goldenheart,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and gave him his dismissal for
      the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius submitted to his fate; there was something in her eyes which
      warned him that he had ventured far enough for that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I call again, soon?&rdquo; he asked piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; answered a voice at the door which they both recognized&mdash;the
      voice of Mrs. Farnaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Regina whispered to him, as her aunt entered the room. Mrs.
      Farnaby&rsquo;s interference, following on the earlier events of the day, had
      touched the young lady&rsquo;s usually placable temper in a tender place&mdash;and
      Amelius reaped the benefit of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby walked straight up to him, put her hand in his arm, and led
      him out into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had my suspicions,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and I find they have not misled me.
      Twice already, I have warned you to let my niece alone. For the third, and
      last time, I tell you that she is as cold as ice. She will trifle with you
      as long as it flatters her vanity; and she will throw you over, as she has
      thrown other men over. Have your fling, you foolish fellow, before you
      marry anybody. Pay no more visits to this house, unless they are visits to
      me. I shall expect to hear from you.&rdquo; She paused, and pointed to a statue
      which was one of the ornaments in the hall. &ldquo;Look at that bronze woman
      with the clock in her hand. That&rsquo;s Regina. Be off with you&mdash;goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius found himself in the street. Regina was looking out at the
      dining-room window. He kissed his hand to her: she smiled and bowed. &ldquo;Damn
      the other men!&rdquo; Amelius said to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call on her tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      Returning to his hotel, he found three letters waiting for him on the
      sitting-room table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first letter that he opened was from his landlord, and contained his
      bill for the past week. As he looked at the sum total, Amelius presented
      to perfection the aspect of a serious young man. He took pen, ink, and
      paper, and made some elaborate calculations. Money that he had too
      generously lent, or too freely given away, appeared in his statement of
      expenses, as well as money that he had spent on himself. The result may be
      plainly stated in his own words: &ldquo;Goodbye to the hotel; I must go into
      lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having arrived at this wise decision, he opened the second letter. It
      proved to be written by the lawyers who had already communicated with him
      at Tadmor, on the subject of his inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The enclosed, insufficiently addressed as you will perceive, only reached
      us this day. We beg to remain, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius opened the letter enclosed, and turned to the signature for
      information. The name instantly took him back to the Community: the writer
      was Mellicent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her letter began abruptly, in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember what I said to you when we parted at Tadmor? I said, &lsquo;Be
      comforted, Amelius, the end is not yet.&rsquo; And I said again, &lsquo;You will come
      back to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remind you of this, my friend&mdash;directing to your lawyers, whose
      names I remember when their letter to you was publicly read in the Common
      Room. Once or twice a year I shall continue to remind you of those parting
      words of mine: there will be a time perhaps when you will thank me for
      doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the mean while, light your pipe with my letters; my letters don&rsquo;t
      matter. If I can comfort you, and reconcile you to your life&mdash;years
      hence, when you, too, my Amelius, may be one of the Fallen Leaves like me&mdash;then
      I shall not have lived and suffered in vain; my last days on earth will be
      the happiest days that I have ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be pleased not to answer these lines, or any other written words of mine
      that may follow, so long as you are prosperous and happy. With <i>that</i>
      part of your life I have nothing to do. You will find friends wherever you
      go&mdash;among the women especially. Your generous nature shows itself
      frankly in your face; your manly gentleness and sweetness speak in every
      tone of your voice; we poor women feel drawn towards you by an attraction
      which we are not able to resist. Have you fallen in love already with some
      beautiful English girl? Oh, be careful and prudent! Be sure, before you
      set your heart on her, that she is worthy of you! So many women are cruel
      and deceitful. Some of them will make you believe you have won their love,
      when you have only flattered their vanity; and some are poor weak
      creatures whose minds are set on their own interests, and who may let bad
      advisers guide them, when you are not by. For your own sake, take care!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am living with my sister, at New York. The days and weeks glide by me
      quietly; you are in my thoughts and my prayers; I have nothing to complain
      of; I wait and hope. When the time of my banishment from the Community has
      expired, I shall go back to Tadmor; and there you will find me, Amelius,
      the first to welcome you when your spirits are sinking under the burden of
      life, and your heart turns again to the friends of your early days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye, my dear&mdash;goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius laid the letter aside, touched and saddened by the artless
      devotion to him which it expressed. He was conscious also of a feeling of
      uneasy surprise, when he read the lines which referred to his possible
      entanglement with some beautiful English girl. Here, with widely different
      motives, was Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s warning repeated, by a stranger writing from
      another quarter of the globe! It was an odd coincidence, to say the least
      of it. After thinking for a while, he turned abruptly to the third letter
      that was waiting for him. He was not at ease; his mind felt the need of
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third letter was from Rufus Dingwell; announcing the close of his tour
      in Ireland, and his intention of shortly joining Amelius in London. The
      excellent American expressed, with his customary absence of reserve, his
      fervent admiration of Irish hospitality, Irish beauty, and Irish whisky.
      &ldquo;Green Erin wants but one thing more,&rdquo; Rufus predicted, &ldquo;to be a Paradise
      on earth&mdash;it wants the day to come when we shall send an American
      minister to the Irish Republic.&rdquo; Laughing over this quaint outbreak,
      Amelius turned from the first page to the second. As his eyes fell on the
      next paragraph, a sudden change passed over him; he let the letter drop on
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One last word,&rdquo; the American wrote, &ldquo;about that nice long bright letter
      of yours. I have read it with strict attention, and thought over it
      considerably afterwards. Don&rsquo;t be riled, friend Amelius, if I tell you in
      plain words, that your account of the Farnabys doesn&rsquo;t make me happy&mdash;quite
      the contrary, I do assure you. My back is set up, sir, against that
      family. You will do well to drop them; and, above all things, mind what
      you are about with the brown miss, who has found her way to your
      favourable opinion in such an almighty hurry. Do me a favour, my good boy.
      Just wait till I have seen her, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby, Mellicent, Rufus&mdash;all three strangers to each other;
      and all three agreed nevertheless in trying to part him from the beautiful
      young Englishwoman! &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Amelius thought to himself &ldquo;They may
      say what they please&mdash;I&rsquo;ll marry Regina, if she will have me!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      In an interval of no more than three weeks what events may not present
      themselves? what changes may not take place? Behold Amelius, on the first
      drizzling day of November, established in respectable lodgings, at a
      moderate weekly rent. He stands before his small fireside, and warms his
      back with an Englishman&rsquo;s severe sense of enjoyment. The cheap
      looking-glass on the mantelpiece reflects the head and shoulders of a new
      Amelius. His habits are changed; his social position is in course of
      development. Already, he is a strict economist. Before long, he expects to
      become a married man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is good to be economical: it is, perhaps, better still to be the
      accepted husband of a handsome young woman. But, for all that, a man in a
      state of moral improvement, with prospects which his less favoured fellow
      creatures may reasonably envy, is still a man subject to the mischievous
      mercy of circumstances, and capable of feeling it keenly. The face of the
      new Amelius wore an expression of anxiety, and, more remarkable yet, the
      temper of the new Amelius was out of order.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in his life he found himself considering trivial
      questions of sixpences, and small favours of discount for cash payments&mdash;an
      irritating state of things in itself. There were more serious anxieties,
      however, to trouble him than these. He had no reason to complain of the
      beloved object herself. Not twelve hours since he had said to Regina, with
      a voice that faltered, and a heart that beat wildly, &ldquo;Are you fond enough
      of me to let me marry you?&rdquo; And she had answered placidly, with a heart
      that would have satisfied the most exacting stethoscope in the medical
      profession, &ldquo;Yes, if you like.&rdquo; There was a moment of rapture, when she
      submitted for the first time to be kissed, and when she consented, on
      being gently reminded that it was expected of her, to return the kiss&mdash;once,
      and no more. But there was also an attendant train of serious
      considerations which followed on the heels of Amelius when the kissing was
      over, and when he had said goodbye for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had two women for enemies, both resolutely against him in the matter of
      his marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina&rsquo;s correspondent and bosom friend, Cecilia, who had begun by
      disliking him, without knowing why, persisted in maintaining her
      unfavourable opinion of the new friend of the Farnabys. She was a young
      married woman; and she had an influence over Regina which promised, when
      the fit opportunity came, to make itself felt. The second, and by far the
      more powerful hostile influence, was the influence of Mrs. Farnaby.
      Nothing could exceed the half sisterly, half motherly, goodwill with which
      she received Amelius on those rare occasions when they happened to meet,
      unembarrassed by the presence of a third person in the room. Without
      actually reverting to what had passed between them during their memorable
      interview, Mrs. Farnaby asked questions, plainly showing that the forlorn
      hope which she associated with Amelius was a hope still firmly rooted in
      her mind. &ldquo;Have you been much about London lately?&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you met with any
      girls who have taken your fancy?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you getting tired of staying in the
      same place, and are you going to travel soon?&rdquo; Inquiries such as these she
      was, sooner or later, sure to make when they were alone. But if Regina
      happened to enter the room, or if Amelius contrived to find his way to her
      in some other part of the house, Mrs. Farnaby deliberately shortened the
      interview and silenced the lovers&mdash;still as resolute as ever to keep
      Amelius exposed to the adventurous freedom of a bachelor&rsquo;s life. For the
      last week, his only opportunities of speaking to Regina had been obtained
      for him secretly by the well-rewarded devotion of her maid. And he had now
      the prospect before him of asking Mr. Farnaby for the hand of his adopted
      daughter, with the certainty of the influence of two women being used
      against him&mdash;even if he succeeded in obtaining a favourable reception
      for his proposal from the master of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under such circumstances as these&mdash;alone, on a rainy November day, in
      a lodging on the dreary eastward side of the Tottenham Court Road&mdash;even
      Amelius bore the aspect of a melancholy man. He was angry with his cigar
      because it refused to light freely. He was angry with the poor deaf
      servant-of-all-work, who entered the room, after one thumping knock at the
      door, and made, in muffled tones, the barbarous announcement, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
      somebody a-wantin&rsquo; to see yer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil is Somebody?&rdquo; Amelius shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody is a citizen of the United States,&rdquo; answered Rufus, quietly
      entering the room. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s sorry to find Claude A. Goldenheart&rsquo;s
      temperature at boiling-point already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not altered in the slightest degree since he had left the steamship
      at Queenstown. Irish hospitality had not fattened him; the change from sea
      to land had not suggested to him the slightest alteration in his dress. He
      still wore the huge felt hat in which he had first presented himself to
      notice on the deck of the vessel. The maid-of-all-work raised her eyes to
      the face of the long lean stranger, overshadowed by the broadbrimmed hat,
      in reverent amazement. &ldquo;My love to you, miss,&rdquo; said Rufus, with his
      customary grave cordiality; <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll</i> shut the door.&rdquo; Having dismissed
      the maid with that gentle hint, he shook hands heartily with Amelius.
      &ldquo;Well, I call this a juicy morning,&rdquo; he said, just as if they had met at
      the cabin breakfast-table as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, at least, Amelius brightened at the sight of his
      fellow-traveller. &ldquo;I am really glad to see you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lonely in
      these new quarters, before one gets used to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus relieved himself of his hat and great coat, and silently looked
      about the room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m big in the bones,&rdquo; he remarked, surveying the rickety
      lodging-house furniture with some suspicion; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m a trifle heavier
      than I look. I shan&rsquo;t break one of these chairs if I sit down on it, shall
      I?&rdquo; Passing round the table (littered with books and letters) in search of
      the nearest chair, he accidentally brushed against a sheet of paper with
      writing on it. &ldquo;Memorandum of friends in London, to be informed of my
      change of address,&rdquo; he read, looking at the paper, as he picked it up,
      with the friendly freedom that characterized him. &ldquo;You have made pretty
      good use of your time, my son, since I took my leave of you in Queenstown
      harbour. I call this a reasonable long list of acquaintances made by a
      young stranger in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met with an old friend of my family at the hotel,&rdquo; Amelius explained.
      &ldquo;He was a great loss to my poor father, when he got an appointment in
      India; and, now he has returned, he has been equally kind to me. I am
      indebted to his introduction for most of the names on that list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Rufus, in the interrogative tone of a man who was waiting to
      hear more. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening, though I may not look like it. Git along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked at his visitor, wondering in what precise direction he was
      to &ldquo;git along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no friend to partial information,&rdquo; Rufus proceeded; &ldquo;I like to round
      it off complete, as it were, in my own mind. There are names on this list
      that you haven&rsquo;t accounted for yet. Who provided you, sir, with the
      balance of your new friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius answered, not very willingly, &ldquo;I met them at Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus looked up from the list with the air of a man surprised by
      disagreeable information, and unwilling to receive it too readily. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
       he exclaimed, using the old English equivalent (often heard in America)
      for the modern &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met them at Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Amelius repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you happen to receive a letter of my writing, dated Dublin?&rdquo; Rufus
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you set any particular value on my advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you cultivate social relations with Farnaby and family,
      notwithstanding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have motives for being friendly with them, which&mdash;which I haven&rsquo;t
      had time to explain to you yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus stretched out his long legs on the floor, and fixed his shrewd grave
      eyes steadily on Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;in respect of personal appearance and
      pleasing elasticity of spirits, I find you altered for the worse, I do. It
      may be Liver, or it may be Love. I reckon, now I think of it, you&rsquo;re too
      young yet for Liver. It&rsquo;s the brown miss&mdash;that&rsquo;s what &lsquo;tis. I hate
      that girl, sir, by instinct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice way of talking of a young lady you never saw!&rdquo; Amelius broke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus smiled grimly. &ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you can get vent in
      quarrelling with me, go ahead, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round the room again, with his hands in his pockets, whistling.
      Descending to the table in due course of time, his quick eye detected a
      photograph placed on the open writing desk which Amelius had been using
      earlier in the day. Before it was possible to stop him, the photograph was
      in his hand. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve got her likeness,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I do assure
      you I take pleasure in making her acquaintance in this sort of way. Well,
      now, I declare she&rsquo;s a columnar creature! Yes, sir; I do justice to your
      native produce&mdash;your fine fleshy beef-fed English girl. But I tell
      you this: after a child or two, that sort runs to fat, and you find you
      have married more of her than you bargained for. To what lengths may you
      have proceeded, Amelius, with this splendid and spanking person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius was just on the verge of taking offence. &ldquo;Speak of her
      respectfully,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you expect me to answer you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus stared in astonishment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m paying her all manner of compliments,&rdquo;
       he protested, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re not satisfied yet. My friend, I still find
      something about you, on this occasion, which reminds me of meat cut
      against the grain. You&rsquo;re almost nasty&mdash;you are! The air of London, I
      reckon, isn&rsquo;t at all the thing for you. Well, it don&rsquo;t matter to me; I
      like you. Afloat or ashore, I like you. Do you want to know what I should
      do, in your place, if I found myself steering a little too nigh to the
      brown miss? I should&mdash;well, to put it in one word, I should scatter.
      Where&rsquo;s the harm, I&rsquo;ll ask you, if you try another girl or two, before you
      make your mind up. I shall be proud to introduce you to our slim and snaky
      sort at Coolspring. Yes. I mean what I say; and I&rsquo;ll go back with you
      across the pond.&rdquo; Referring in this disrespectful manner to the Atlantic
      Ocean, Rufus offered his hand in token of unalterable devotion and
      goodwill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who could resist such a man as this? Amelius, always in extremes, wrung
      his hand, with an impetuous sense of shame. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sulky,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been rude, I ought to be ashamed of myself&mdash;and I am. There&rsquo;s
      only one excuse for me, Rufus. I love her with all my heart and soul; and
      I&rsquo;m engaged to be married to her. And yet, if you understand my way of
      putting it, I&rsquo;m&mdash;in short, I&rsquo;m in a mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this characteristic preface, he described his position as exactly as
      he could; having due regard to the necessary reserve on the subject of
      Mrs. Farnaby. Rufus listened, with the closest attention, from beginning
      to end; making no attempt to disguise the unfavourable impression which
      the announcement of the marriage-engagement had made on him. When he spoke
      next, instead of looking at Amelius as usual, he held his head down, and
      looked gloomily at his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve gone ahead this time, and that&rsquo;s a fact. She
      didn&rsquo;t raise any difficulties that a man could ride off on&mdash;did she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was all that was sweet and kind!&rdquo; Amelius answered, with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was all that was sweet and kind,&rdquo; Rufus absently repeated, still
      intent on the solid spectacle of his own boots. &ldquo;And how about uncle
      Farnaby? Perhaps he&rsquo;s sweet and kind likewise, or perhaps he cuts up
      rough? Possible&mdash;is it not, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I haven&rsquo;t spoken to him yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus suddenly looked up. A faint gleam of hope irradiated his long lank
      face. &ldquo;Mercy be praised! there&rsquo;s a last chance for you,&rdquo; he remarked.
      &ldquo;Uncle Farnaby may say No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what he says,&rdquo; Amelius rejoined. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s old enough to
      choose for herself, he can&rsquo;t stop the marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus lifted one wiry yellow forefinger, in a state of perpendicular
      protest. &ldquo;He cannot stop the marriage,&rdquo; the sagacious New Englander
      admitted; &ldquo;but he can stop the money, my son. Find out how you stand with
      him before another day is over your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to him this evening.&rdquo; said Amelius; &ldquo;he dines out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At his place of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fix him at his place of business. Right away!&rdquo; cried Rufus, springing
      with sudden energy to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he would like it,&rdquo; Amelius objected. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a very
      pleasant fellow, anywhere; but he&rsquo;s particularly disagreeable at his place
      of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus walked to the window, and looked out. The objections to Mr. Farnaby
      appeared to fail, so far, in interesting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To put it plainly,&rdquo; Amelius went on, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something about him that I
      can&rsquo;t endure. And&mdash;though he&rsquo;s very civil to me, in his way&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t think he has ever got over the discovery that I am a Christian
      Socialist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus abruptly turned round from the window, and became attentive again.
      &ldquo;So you told him that&mdash;did you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Amelius rejoined, sharply. &ldquo;Do you suppose I am ashamed of
      the principles in which I have been brought up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care, I reckon, if all the world knows your principles,
      persisted Rufus, deliberately leading him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care?&rdquo; Amelius reiterated. &ldquo;I only wish I had all the world to listen to
      me. They should hear of my principles, with no bated breath, I promise
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Rufus turned back again to the window. &ldquo;When Farnaby&rsquo;s
      at home, where does he live?&rdquo; he asked suddenly&mdash;still keeping his
      face towards the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius mentioned the address. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you are going to call
      there?&rdquo; he inquired, with some anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckoned I might catch him before dinner-time. You seem to be
      sort of feared to speak to him yourself. I&rsquo;m your friend, Amelius&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;ll speak for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bare idea of the interview struck Amelius with terror. &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, Rufus. But in a matter of this sort, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t like to transfer the responsibility to my friend. I&rsquo;ll speak to
      Mr. Farnaby in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus was evidently not satisfied with this. &ldquo;I do suppose, now,&rdquo; he
      suggested, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not the only man moving in this metropolis who fancies
      Miss Regina. Query, my son: if you put off Farnaby much longer&mdash;&rdquo; He
      paused and looked at Amelius. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I reckon I needn&rsquo;t enlarge
      further: there <i>is</i> another man. Well, it&rsquo;s the same in my country; I
      don&rsquo;t know what he does, with You: he always turns up, with Us, just at
      the time when you least want to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There <i>was</i> another man&mdash;an older and a richer man than Amelius;
      equally assiduous in his attentions to the aunt and to the niece;
      submissively polite to his favoured young rival. He was the sort of
      person, in age and in temperament, who would be perfectly capable of
      advancing his own interests by means of the hostile influence of Mrs.
      Farnaby. Who could say what the result might be if, by some unlucky
      accident, he made the attempt before Amelius had secured for himself the
      support of the master of the house? In his present condition of nervous
      irritability, he was ready to believe in any coincidence of the disastrous
      sort. The wealthy rival was a man of business, a near city neighbour of
      Mr. Farnaby. They might be together at that moment; and Regina&rsquo;s fidelity
      to her lover might be put to a harder test than she was prepared to
      endure. Amelius remembered the gentle conciliatory smile (too gentle by
      half) with which his placid mistress had received his first kisses&mdash;and,
      without stopping to weigh conclusions, snatched up his hat. &ldquo;Wait here for
      me, Rufus, like a good fellow. I&rsquo;m off to the stationer&rsquo;s shop.&rdquo; With
      those parting words, he hurried out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left by himself, Rufus began to rummage the pockets of his frockcoat&mdash;a
      long, loose, and dingy garment which had become friendly and comfortable
      to him by dint of ancient use. Producing a handful of correspondence, he
      selected the largest envelope of all; shook out on the table several
      smaller letters enclosed; picked one out of the number; and read the
      concluding paragraph only, with the closest attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I enclose letters of introduction to the secretaries of literary
      institutions in London, and in some of the principal cities of England. If
      you feel disposed to lecture yourself, or if you can persuade friends and
      citizens known to you to do so, I believe it may be in your power to
      advance in this way the interests of our Bureau. Please take notice that
      the more advanced institutions, which are ready to countenance and welcome
      free thought in religion, politics, and morals, are marked on the
      envelopes with a cross in red ink. The envelopes without a mark are
      addressed to platforms on which the customary British prejudices remain
      rampant, and in which the charge for places reaches a higher figure than
      can be as yet obtained in the sanctuaries of free thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus laid down the letter, and, choosing one among the envelopes marked
      in red ink, looked at the introduction enclosed. &ldquo;If the right sort of
      invitation reached Amelius from this institution,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the boy
      would lecture on Christian Socialism with all his heart and soul. I wonder
      what the brown miss and her uncle would say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled to himself, and put the letter back in the envelope, and
      considered the subject for a while. Below the odd rough surface, he was a
      man in ten thousand; no more single-hearted and more affectionate creature
      ever breathed the breath of life. He had not been understood in his own
      little circle; there had been a want of sympathy with him, and even a want
      of knowledge of him, at home. Amelius, popular with everybody, had touched
      the great heart of this man. He perceived the peril that lay hidden under
      the strange and lonely position of his fellow-voyager&mdash;so innocent in
      the ways of the world, so young and so easily impressed His fondness for
      Amelius, it is hardly too much to say, was the fondness of a father for a
      son. With a sigh, he shook his head, and gathered up his letters, and put
      them back in his pockets. &ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;The poor boy really
      loves her; and the girl may be good enough to make the happiness of his
      life.&rdquo; He got up and walked about the room. Suddenly he stopped, struck by
      a new idea. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I judge for myself?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the
      address&mdash;I reckon I&rsquo;ll look in on the Farnabys, in a friendly way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down at the desk, and wrote a line, in the event of Amelius being
      the first to return to the lodgings:
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR BOY,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t find her photograph tells me quite so much as I want to know. I
      have a mind to see the living original. Being your friend, you know, it&rsquo;s
      only civil to pay my respects to the family. Expect my unbiased opinion
      when I come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;RUFUS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having enclosed and addressed these lines, he took up his greatcoat&mdash;and
      checked himself in the act of putting it on. The brown miss was a British
      miss. A strange New Englander had better be careful of his personal
      appearance, before he ventured into her presence. Urged by this cautious
      motive, he approached the looking-glass, and surveyed himself critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt I might be the better,&rdquo; it occurred to him, &ldquo;if I brushed my
      hair, and smelt a little of perfume. Yes. I&rsquo;ll make a toilet. Where&rsquo;s the
      boy&rsquo;s bedroom, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He observed a second door in the sitting-room, and opened it at hazard.
      Fortune had befriended him, so far: he found himself in his young friend&rsquo;s
      bedchamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The toilet of Amelius, simple as it was, had its mysteries for Rufus. He
      was at a loss among the perfumes. They were all contained in a modest
      little dressing case, without labels of any sort to describe the contents
      of the pots and bottles. He examined them one after another, and stopped
      at some recently invented French shaving-cream. &ldquo;It smells lovely,&rdquo; he
      said, assuming it to be some rare pomatum. &ldquo;Just what I want, it seems,
      for my head.&rdquo; He rubbed the shaving cream into his bristly iron-gray hair,
      until his arms ached. When he had next sprinkled his handkerchief and
      himself profusely, first with rose water, and then (to make quite sure)
      with eau-de-cologne used as a climax, he felt that he was in a position to
      appeal agreeably to the senses of the softer sex. In five minutes more, he
      was on his way to Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s private residence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rain that had begun with the morning still poured on steadily in the
      afternoon. After one look out of the window, Regina decided on passing the
      rest of the day luxuriously, in the company of a novel, by her own
      fireside. With her feet on the tender, and her head on the soft cushion of
      her favourite easy-chair, she opened the book. Having read the first
      chapter and part of the second, she was just lazily turning over the
      leaves in search of a love scene, when her languid interest in the novel
      was suddenly diverted to an incident in real life. The sitting-room door
      was gently opened, and her maid appeared in a state of modest confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, miss, here&rsquo;s a strange gentleman who comes from Mr.
      Goldenheart. He wishes particularly to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and looked behind her. A faint and curious smell of mingled
      soap and scent entered the room, followed closely by a tall, calm,
      shabbily-dressed man, who laid a wiry yellow hand on the maid&rsquo;s shoulder,
      and stopped her effectually before she could say a word more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think of troubling yourself to git through with it, my dear;
      I&rsquo;m here, and I&rsquo;ll finish for you.&rdquo; Addressing the maid in these
      encouraging terms, the stranger advanced to Regina, and actually attempted
      to shake hands with her! Regina rose&mdash;and looked at him. It was a
      look that ought to have daunted the boldest man living; it produced no
      sort of effect on <i>this</i> man. He still held out his hand; his lean
      face broadened with a pleasant smile. &ldquo;My name is Rufus Dingwell,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I come from Coolspring, Mass.; and Amelius is my introduction to
      yourself and family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina silently acknowledged this information by a frigid bow, and
      addressed herself to the maid, waiting at the door: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave the room,
      Phoebe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus, inwardly wondering what Phoebe was wanted for, proceeded to express
      the cordial sentiments proper to the occasion. &ldquo;I have heard about you,
      miss; and I take pleasure in making your acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unwritten laws of politeness obliged Regina to say something. &ldquo;I have
      not heard Mr. Goldenheart mention your name,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Are you an
      old friend of his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus explained with genial alacrity. &ldquo;We crossed the Pond together, miss.
      I like the boy; he&rsquo;s bright and spry; he refreshes me&mdash;he does. We go
      ahead with most things in my country; and friendship&rsquo;s one of them. How <i>do</i>
      you find yourself? Won&rsquo;t you shake hands?&rdquo; He took her hand, without
      waiting to be repelled this time, and shook it with the heartiest
      good-will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina shuddered faintly: she summoned assistance in case of further
      familiarity. &ldquo;Phoebe, tell my aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus added a message on his own account. &ldquo;And say this, my dear. I
      sincerely desire to make the acquaintance of Miss Regina&rsquo;s aunt, and any
      other members of the family circle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe left the room, smiling. Such an amusing visitor as this was a rare
      person in Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s house. Rufus looked after her, with unconcealed
      approval. The maid appeared to be more to his taste than the mistress.
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a pretty creature, I do declare,&rdquo; he said to Regina.
      &ldquo;Reminds me of our American girls&mdash;slim in the waist, and carries her
      head nicely. How old may she be, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina expressed her opinion of this familiar question by pointing, with
      silent dignity, to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, miss; not that one,&rdquo; said Rufus. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m long in the
      legs, and if I once got down as low as that, I reckon I should have to
      restore the balance by putting my feet up on the grate; and that&rsquo;s not
      manners in Great Britain&mdash;and quite right too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked out the highest chair he could find, and admired the workmanship
      as he drew it up to the fireplace. &ldquo;Most sumptuous and elegant,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;The style of the Re<i>nay</i>sance, as they call it.&rdquo; Regina observed
      with dismay that he had not got his hat in his hand like other visitors.
      He had left it no doubt in the hall; he looked as if he had dropped in to
      spend the day, and stay to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, miss, I&rsquo;ve seen your photograph,&rdquo; he resumed; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t much
      approve of it, now I see You. My sentiments are not altogether favourable
      to that art. I delivered a lecture on photographic portraiture at
      Coolspring; and I described it briefly as justice without mercy. The
      audience took the idea; they larfed, they did. Larfin&rsquo; reminds me of
      Amelius. Do you object to his being a Christian Socialist, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady&rsquo;s look, when she answered the question, was not lost on
      Rufus. He registered it, mentally, in case of need. &ldquo;Amelius will soon get
      over all that nonsense,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when he has been a little longer in
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possible,&rdquo; Rufus admitted. &ldquo;The boy is fond of you. Yes: he loves you. I
      have noticed him, and I can certify to that. I may also remark that he
      wants a deal of love in return. No doubt, miss, you have observed that
      circumstance yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina resented this last inquiry as an outrage on propriety. &ldquo;What next
      will he say?&rdquo; she thought to herself. &ldquo;I must put this presuming man in
      his proper place.&rdquo; She darted another annihilating look at him, as she
      spoke in her turn. &ldquo;May I ask, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dingwell,&rdquo; said Rufus, prompting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask, Mr. Dingwell, if you have favoured me by calling here at the
      request of Mr. Goldenheart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Genial and simple-minded as he was, eagerly as he desired to appreciate at
      her full value the young lady who was one day to be the wife of Amelius,
      Rufus felt the tone in which those words were spoken. It was not easy to
      stimulate his modest sense of what was fairly due to him into asserting
      itself, but the cold distrust, the deliberate distance of Regina&rsquo;s manner,
      exhausted the long-suffering indulgence of this singularly patient man.
      &ldquo;The Lord, in his mercy, preserve Amelius from marrying You,&rdquo; he thought,
      as he rose from his chair, and advanced with a certain simple dignity to
      take leave of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did not occur to me, miss, to pay my respects to you, till Amelius and
      I had parted company,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Please to excuse me. I should have been
      welcome, in my country, with no better introduction than being (as I may
      say) his friend and well-wisher. If I have made a mistake&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. Regina had suddenly changed colour. Instead of looking at him,
      she was looking over his shoulder, apparently at something behind him. He
      turned to see what it was. A lady, short and stout, with strange wild
      sorrowful eyes, had noiselessly entered the room while he was speaking:
      she was waiting, as it seemed, until he had finished what he had to say.
      When they confronted each other, she moved to meet him, with a firm heavy
      step, and with her hand held out in token of welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may feel equally sure, sir, of a friendly reception here,&rdquo; she said,
      in her steady self-possessed way. &ldquo;I am this young lady&rsquo;s aunt; and I am
      glad to see the friend of Amelius in my house.&rdquo; Before Rufus could answer,
      she turned to Regina. &ldquo;I waited,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;to give you an opportunity
      of explaining yourself to this gentleman. I am afraid he has mistaken your
      coldness of manner for intentional rudeness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colour rushed back into Regina&rsquo;s face&mdash;she vibrated for a moment
      between anger and tears. But the better nature in her broke its way
      through the constitutional shyness and restraint which habitually kept it
      down. &ldquo;I meant no harm, sir,&rdquo; she said, raising her large beautiful eyes
      submissively to Rufus; &ldquo;I am not used to receiving strangers. And you did
      ask me some very strange questions,&rdquo; she added, with a sudden burst of
      self-assertion. &ldquo;Strangers are not in the habit of saying such things in
      England.&rdquo; She looked at Mrs. Farnaby, listening with impenetrable
      composure, and stopped in confusion. Her aunt would not scruple to speak
      to the stranger about Amelius in her presence&mdash;there was no knowing
      what she might not have to endure. She turned again to Rufus. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;if I leave you with my aunt&mdash;I have an engagement.&rdquo; With
      that trivial apology, she made her escape from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has no engagement,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby briefly remarked as the door closed.
      &ldquo;Sit down, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once, even Rufus was not as his ease. &ldquo;I can hit it off, ma&rsquo;am, with
      most people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wonder what I&rsquo;ve done to offend your niece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My niece (with many good qualities) is a narrow-minded young woman,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Farnaby explained. &ldquo;You are not like the men she is accustomed to see. She
      doesn&rsquo;t understand you&mdash;you are not a commonplace gentleman. For
      instance,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby continued, with the matter-of-fact gravity of a
      woman innately inaccessible to a sense of humour, &ldquo;you have got something
      strange on your hair. It seems to be melting, and it smells like soap. No:
      it&rsquo;s no use taking out your handkerchief&mdash;your handkerchief won&rsquo;t mop
      it up. I&rsquo;ll get a towel.&rdquo; She opened an inner door, which disclosed a
      little passage, and a bath-room beyond it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the strongest person in
      the house,&rdquo; she resumed, returning with a towel in her hand, as gravely as
      ever. &ldquo;Sit still, and don&rsquo;t make apologies. If any of us can rub you dry,
      I&rsquo;m the woman.&rdquo; She set to work with the towel, as if she had been Rufus&rsquo;s
      mother, making him presentable in the days of his boyhood. Giddy under the
      violence of the rubbing, staggered by the contrast between the cold
      reception accorded to him by the niece, and the more than friendly welcome
      offered by the aunt, Rufus submitted to circumstances in docile and silent
      bewilderment. &ldquo;There; you&rsquo;ll do till you get home&mdash;nobody can laugh
      at you now,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby announced. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an absent-minded man, I
      suppose? You wanted to wash your head, and you forgot the warm water and
      the towel. Was that how it happened, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you with all my heart, ma&rsquo;am; I took it for pomatum,&rdquo; Rufus
      answered. &ldquo;Would you object to shaking hands again? This cordial welcome
      of yours reminds me, I do assure you, of home. Since I left New England,
      I&rsquo;ve never met with the like of you. I do suppose now it was my hair that
      set Miss Regina&rsquo;s back up? I&rsquo;m not quite easy in my mind, ma&rsquo;am, about
      your niece. I&rsquo;m sort of feared of what she may say of me to Amelius. I
      meant no harm, Lord knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secret of Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s extraordinary alacrity in the use of the
      towel began slowly to show itself now. The tone of her American guest had
      already become the friendly and familiar tone which it had been her object
      to establish. With a little management, he might be made an invaluable
      ally in the great work of hindering the marriage of Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very fond of your young friend?&rdquo; she began quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has told you that he has taken a liking to my niece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shown me her likeness,&rdquo; Rufus added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shown you her likeness. And you thought you would come here, and see
      for yourself what sort of girl she was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Rufus admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby revealed, without further hesitation, the object that she had
      in view. &ldquo;Amelius is little more than a lad, still,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He has got
      all his life before him. It would be a sad thing, if he married a girl who
      didn&rsquo;t make him happy.&rdquo; She turned in her chair, and pointed to the door
      by which Regina had left them. &ldquo;Between ourselves,&rdquo; she resumed, dropping
      her voice to a whisper, &ldquo;do you believe my niece will make him happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m above family prejudices,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby proceeded. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be
      afraid of offending me. Speak out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus would have spoken out to any other woman in the universe. <i>This</i>
      woman had preserved him from ridicule&mdash;<i>this</i> woman had rubbed
      his head dry. He prevaricated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I understand the ladies in this country,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Farnaby was not to be trifled with. &ldquo;If Amelius was your son, and
      if he asked you to consent to his marriage with my niece,&rdquo; she rejoined,
      &ldquo;would you say Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for Rufus. &ldquo;Not if he went down on both his knees to ask
      me,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby was satisfied at last, and owned it without reserve. &ldquo;My own
      opinion,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;exactly expressed! don&rsquo;t be surprised. Didn&rsquo;t I tell
      you I had no family prejudices? Do you know if he has spoken to my
      husband, yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus looked at his watch. &ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;s just about done it by this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby paused, and reflected for a moment. She had already attempted
      to prejudice her husband against Amelius, and had received an answer which
      Mr. Farnaby considered to be final. &ldquo;Mr. Goldenheart honours us if he
      seeks our alliance; he is the representative of an old English family.&rdquo;
       Under these circumstances, it was quite possible that the proposals of
      Amelius had been accepted. Mrs. Farnaby was not the less determined that
      the marriage should never take place, and not the less eager to secure the
      assistance of her new ally. &ldquo;When will Amelius tell you about it?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I go back to his lodgings, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back at once&mdash;and bear this in mind as you go. If you can find
      out any likely way of parting these two young people (in their own best
      interests), depend on one thing&mdash;if I can help you, I will. I&rsquo;m as
      fond of Amelius as you are. Ask him if I haven&rsquo;t done my best to keep him
      away from my niece. Ask him if I haven&rsquo;t expressed my opinion, that she&rsquo;s
      not the right wife for him. Come and see me again as soon as you like. I&rsquo;m
      fond of Americans. Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus attempted to express his sense of gratitude, in his own briefly
      eloquent way. He was not allowed a hearing. With one and the same action,
      Mrs. Farnaby patted him on the shoulder, and pushed him out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that woman was an American citizen,&rdquo; Rufus reflected, on his way
      through the streets, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d be the first female President of the United
      States!&rdquo; His admiration of Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s energy and resolution, expressed
      in these strong terms, acknowledged but one limit. Highly as he approved
      of her, there was nevertheless an unfathomable something in the woman&rsquo;s
      eyes that disturbed and daunted him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rufus found his friend at the lodgings, prostrate on the sofa, smoking
      furiously. Before a word had passed between them, it was plain to the New
      Englander that something had gone wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;and what does Farnaby say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn Farnaby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus was secretly conscious of an immense sense of relief. &ldquo;I call that a
      stiff way of putting it,&rdquo; he quietly remarked; &ldquo;but the meaning&rsquo;s clear.
      Farnaby has said No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius jumped off the sofa, and planted himself defiantly on the
      hearthrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong for once,&rdquo; he said, with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;The exasperating
      part of it is that Farnaby has said neither Yes nor No. The oily-whiskered
      brute&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t seen him yet, have you?&mdash;began by saying Yes.
      &lsquo;A man like me, the heir of a fine old English family, honoured him by
      making proposals; he could wish no more brilliant prospect for his dear
      adopted child. She would fill the high position that was offered to her,
      and fill it worthily.&rsquo; That was the fawning way in which he talked to me
      at first! He squeezed my hand in his horrid cold shiny paw till, I give
      you my word of honour, I felt as if I was going to be sick. Wait a little;
      you haven&rsquo;t heard the worst of it yet. He soon altered his tone&mdash;it
      began with his asking me, if I had &lsquo;considered the question of
      settlements&rsquo;. I didn&rsquo;t know what he meant. He had to put it in plain
      English; he wanted to hear what my property was. &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s soon
      settled,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got five hundred a year; and Regina is welcome to
      every farthing of it.&rsquo; He fell back in his chair as if I had shot him; he
      turned&mdash;it was worse than pale, he positively turned green. At first
      he wouldn&rsquo;t believe me; he declared I must be joking. I set him right
      about that immediately. His next change was a proud impudence. &lsquo;Have you
      not observed, sir, in what style Regina is accustomed to live in my house?
      Five hundred a year? Good heavens! With strict economy, five hundred a
      year might pay her milliner&rsquo;s bill and the keep of her horse and carriage.
      Who is to pay for everything else&mdash;the establishment, the
      dinner-parties and balls, the tour abroad, the children, the nurses, the
      doctor? I tell you this, Mr. Goldenheart, I&rsquo;m willing to make a sacrifice
      to you, as a born gentleman, which I would certainly not consent to in the
      case of any self-made man. Enlarge your income, sir, to no more than four
      times five hundred pounds, and I guarantee a yearly allowance to Regina of
      half as much again, besides the fortune which she will inherit at my
      death. That will make your income three thousand a year to start with. I
      know something of domestic expenses, and I tell you positively, you can&rsquo;t
      do it on a farthing less.&rsquo; That was his language, Rufus. The insolence of
      his tone I can&rsquo;t attempt to describe. If I hadn&rsquo;t thought of Regina, I
      should have behaved in a manner unworthy of a Christian&mdash;I believe I
      should have taken my walking-cane, and given him a sound thrashing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus neither expressed surprise nor offered advice. He was lost in
      meditation on the wealth of Mr. Farnaby. &ldquo;A stationer&rsquo;s business seems to
      eventuate in a lively profit, in this country,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stationer&rsquo;s business?&rdquo; Amelius repeated disdainfully. &ldquo;Farnaby has half
      a dozen irons in the fire besides that. He&rsquo;s got a newspaper, and a patent
      medicine, and a new bank, and I don&rsquo;t know what else. One of his own
      friends said to me, &lsquo;Nobody knows whether Farnaby is rich or poor; he is
      going to do one of two things&mdash;he is going to die worth millions, or
      to die bankrupt.&rsquo; Oh, if I can only live to see the day when Socialism
      will put that sort of man in his right place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try a republic, on our model, first,&rdquo; said Rufus. &ldquo;When Farnaby talks of
      the style his young woman is accustomed to live in, what does he mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means,&rdquo; Amelius answered smartly, &ldquo;a carriage to drive out in,
      champagne on the table, and a footman to answer the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farnaby&rsquo;s ideas, sir, have crossed the water and landed in New York,&rdquo;
       Rufus remarked. &ldquo;Well, and what did you say to him, on your side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave it to him, I can tell you! &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all ostentation,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Why
      can&rsquo;t Regina and I begin life modestly? What do we want with a carriage to
      drive out in, and champagne on the table, and a footman to answer the
      door? We want to love each other and be happy. There are thousands of as
      good gentlemen as I am, in England, with wives and families, who would ask
      for nothing better than an income of five hundred a year. The fact is, Mr.
      Farnaby, you&rsquo;re positively saturated with the love of money. Get your New
      Testament and read what Christ says of rich people.&rsquo; What do you think he
      did, when I put it in that unanswerable way? He held up his hand, and
      looked horrified. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t allow profanity in my office,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I have
      my New Testament read to me in church, sir, every Sunday.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the sort
      of Christian, Rufus, who is the average product of modern times! He was as
      obstinate as a mule; he wouldn&rsquo;t give way a single inch. His adopted
      daughter, he said, was accustomed to live in a certain style. In that same
      style she should live when she was married, so long as he had a voice in
      the matter. Of course, if she chose to set his wishes and feelings at
      defiance, in return for all that he had done for her, she was old enough
      to take her own way. In that case, he would tell me as plainly as he meant
      to tell her, that she must not look to a single farthing of his money to
      help her, and not expect to find her name down in his will. He felt the
      honour of a family alliance with me as sincerely as ever. But he must
      abide by the conditions that he had stated. On those terms, he would be
      proud to give me the hand of Regina at the altar, and proud to feel that
      he had done his duty by his adopted child. I let him go on till he had run
      himself out&mdash;and then I asked quietly, if he could tell me the way to
      increase my income to two thousand a year. How do you think he answered
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he offered to utilise your capital in his business,&rdquo; Rufus
      guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he! He considered business quite beneath me; my duty to myself, as a
      gentleman, was to adopt a profession. On reflection, it turned out that
      there was but one likely profession to try, in my case&mdash;the Law. I
      might be called to the Bar, and (with luck) I might get remunerative work
      to do, in eight or ten years&rsquo; time. That, I declare to you, was the
      prospect he set before me, if I chose to take his advice. I asked if he
      was joking. Certainly not! I was only one-and-twenty years old (he
      reminded me); I had plenty of time to spare&mdash;I should still marry
      young if I married at thirty. I took up my hat, and gave him a bit of my
      mind at parting. &lsquo;If you really mean anything,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you mean that
      Regina is to pine and fade and be a middle-aged woman, and that I am to
      resist the temptations that beset a young man in London, and lead the life
      of a monk for the next ten years&mdash;and all for what? For a carriage to
      ride out in, champagne on the table, and a footman to answer the door!
      Keep your money, Mr. Farnaby; Regina and I will do without it.&rsquo;&mdash;What
      are you laughing at? I don&rsquo;t think you could have put it more strongly
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus suddenly recovered his gravity. &ldquo;I tell you this, Amelius,&rdquo; he
      replied; &ldquo;you afford (as we say in my country) meaty fruit for reflection&mdash;you
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon you remember when we were aboard the boat. You gave us a
      narrative of what happened in that Community of yours, which I can truly
      cha<i>rac</i>terise as a combination of native eloquence and chastening
      good sense. I put the question to myself, sir, what has become of that
      well-informed and discreet young Christian, now he has changed the sphere
      to England and mixed with the Farnabys? It&rsquo;s not to be denied that I see
      him before me in the flesh when I look across the table here; but it&rsquo;s
      equally true that I miss him altogether, in the spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius sat down again on the sofa. &ldquo;In plain words,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you think
      I have behaved like a fool in this matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus crossed his long legs, and nodded his head in silent approval.
      Instead of taking offence, Amelius considered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t strike me before,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But, now you mention it, I can
      understand that I appear to be a simple sort of fellow in what is called
      Society here; and the reason, I suspect, is that it&rsquo;s not the society in
      which I have been accustomed to mix. The Farnabys are new to me, Rufus.
      When it comes to a question of my life at Tadmor, of what I saw and learnt
      and felt in the Community&mdash;then, I can think and speak like a
      reasonable being, because I am thinking and speaking of what I know
      thoroughly well. Hang it, make some allowance for the difference of
      circumstances! Besides, I&rsquo;m in love, and that alters a man&mdash;and, I
      have heard some people say, not always for the better. Anyhow, I&rsquo;ve done
      it with Farnaby, and it can&rsquo;t be undone. There will be no peace for me
      now, till I have spoken to Regina. I have read the note you left for me.
      Did you see her, when you called at the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quiet tone in which the question was put surprised Rufus. He had fully
      expected, after Regina&rsquo;s reception of him, to be called to account for the
      liberty that he had taken. Amelius was too completely absorbed by his
      present anxieties to consider trivial questions of etiquette. Hearing that
      Rufus had seen Regina, he never even asked for his friend&rsquo;s opinion of
      her. His mind was full of the obstacles that might be interposed to his
      seeing her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farnaby is sure, after what has passed between us, to keep her out of my
      way if he can,&rdquo; Amelius said. &ldquo;And Mrs. Farnaby, to my certain knowledge,
      will help him. They don&rsquo;t suspect <i>you.</i> Couldn&rsquo;t you call again&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      old enough to be her father&mdash;and make some excuse to take her out
      with you for a walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer of Rufus to this was Roman in its brevity. He pointed to the
      window, and said, &ldquo;Look at the rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must try her maid once more,&rdquo; said Amelius, resignedly. He took
      his hat and umbrella. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me, old fellow,&rdquo; he resumed as he
      opened the door. &ldquo;This is the turning-point of my life. I&rsquo;m sorely in need
      of a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she will marry you against the will of her uncle and aunt?&rdquo;
       Rufus asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain of it,&rdquo; Amelius answered. With that he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus looked after him sadly. Sympathy and sorrow were expressed in every
      line of his rugged face. &ldquo;My poor boy! how will he bear it, if she says
      No? What will become of him, if she says Yes?&rdquo; He rubbed his hand
      irritably across his forehead, like a man whose own thoughts were
      repellent to him. In a moment more, he plunged into his pockets, and drew
      out again the letters introducing him to the secretaries of public
      institutions. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s salvation for Amelius,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I reckon I
      shall find it here.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      The medium of correspondence between Amelius and Regina&rsquo;s maid was an old
      woman who kept a shop for the sale of newspapers and periodicals, in a
      by-street not far from Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s house. From this place his letters
      were delivered to the maid, under cover of the morning newspapers&mdash;and
      here he found the answers waiting for him later in the day. &ldquo;If Rufus
      could only have taken her out for a walk, I might have seen Regina this
      afternoon,&rdquo; thought Amelius. &ldquo;As it is, I may have to wait till to-morrow,
      or later still. And then, there&rsquo;s the sovereign to Phoebe.&rdquo; He sighed as
      he thought of the fee. Sovereigns were becoming scarce in our young
      Socialist&rsquo;s purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arriving in sight of the newsvendor&rsquo;s shop, Amelius noticed a man leaving
      it, who walked away towards the farther end of the street. When he entered
      the shop himself a minute afterwards, the woman took up a letter from the
      counter. &ldquo;A young man has just left this for you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius recognised the maid&rsquo;s handwriting on the address. The man whom he
      had seen leaving the shop was Phoebe&rsquo;s messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the letter. Her mistress, Phoebe explained, was too much
      flurried to be able to write. The master had astonished the whole
      household by appearing among them at least three hours before the time at
      which he was accustomed to leave his place of business. He had found &ldquo;Mrs.
      Ormond&rdquo; (otherwise Regina&rsquo;s friend and correspondent, Cecilia) paying a
      visit to his niece, and had asked to speak with her in private, before she
      took leave. The result was an invitation to Regina, from Mrs. Ormond, to
      stay for a little while at her house in the neighbourhood of Harrow. The
      ladies were to leave London together, in Mrs. Ormond&rsquo;s carriage, that
      afternoon. Under stress of strong persuasion, on the part of her uncle and
      aunt as well as her friend, Regina had ended in giving way. But she had
      not forgotten the interests of Amelius. She was willing to see him
      privately on the next day, provided he left London by the train which
      reached Harrow soon after eleven in the forenoon. If it happened to rain,
      then he must put off his journey until the first fine day, arriving in any
      case at the same hour. The place at which he was to wait was described to
      him; and with these instructions the letter ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rapidity with which Mr. Farnaby had carried out his resolution to
      separate the lovers placed the weakness of Regina&rsquo;s character before
      Amelius in a new and startling light. Why had she not stood on her
      privileges, as a woman who had arrived at years of discretion, and refused
      to leave London until she had first heard what her lover had to say?
      Amelius had left his American friend, feeling sure that Regina&rsquo;s decision
      would be in his favour, when she was called upon to choose between the man
      who was ready to marry her, and the man who was nothing but her uncle by
      courtesy. For the first time, he now felt that his own confident
      anticipations might, by bare possibility, deceive him. He returned to his
      lodgings, in such a state of depression, that compassionate Rufus insisted
      on taking him out to dinner, and hurried him off afterwards to the play.
      Thoroughly prostrated, Amelius submitted to the genial influence of his
      friend. He had not even energy enough to feel surprised when Rufus
      stopped, on their way to the tavern, at a dingy building adorned with a
      Grecian portico, and left a letter and a card in charge of a servant at
      the side-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, by a happy interposition of Fortune, proved to be a day
      without rain. Amelius followed his instructions to the letter. A little
      watery sunshine showed itself as he left the station at Harrow. His mind
      was still in such a state of doubt and disturbance that it drew from
      superstition a faint encouragement to hope. He hailed the feeble November
      sunlight as a good omen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Ormond&rsquo;s place of residence stood alone, surrounded by its
      own grounds. A wooden fence separated the property, on one side, from a
      muddy little by-road, leading to a neighbouring farm. At a wicket-gate in
      this fence, giving admission to a shrubbery situated at some distance from
      the house, Amelius now waited for the appearance of the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a delay of a few minutes only, the faithful Phoebe approached the
      gate with a key in her hand. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; Amelius asked, as the girl
      opened the gate for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting for you in the shrubbery. Stop, sir; I have something to say to
      you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius took out his purse, and produced the fee. Even he had observed
      that Phoebe was perhaps a little too eager to get her money!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir. Please to look at your watch. You mustn&rsquo;t be with Miss
      Regina a moment longer than a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the time, sir, when Mrs. Ormond is engaged every day with her
      cook and housekeeper. In a quarter of an hour the orders will be given&mdash;and
      Mrs. Ormond will join Miss Regina for a walk in the grounds. You will be
      the ruin of me, sir, if she finds you here.&rdquo; With that warning, the maid
      led the way along the winding paths of the shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must thank you for your letter, Phoebe,&rdquo; said Amelius, as he followed
      her. &ldquo;By-the-by, who was your messenger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe&rsquo;s answer was no answer at all. &ldquo;Only a young man, sir,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In plain words, your sweetheart, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe&rsquo;s expressive silence was her only reply. She turned a corner, and
      pointed to her mistress standing alone before the entrance of a damp and
      deserted summer-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina put her handkerchief to her eyes, when the maid had discreetly
      retired. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;I am afraid this is very wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius removed the handkerchief by the exercise of a little gentle force,
      and administered comfort under the form of a kiss. Having opened the
      proceedings in this way, he put his first question, &ldquo;Why did you leave
      London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I help it!&rdquo; said Regina, feebly. &ldquo;They were all against me.
      What else could I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Amelius that she might, at her age, have asserted a will of
      her own. He kept his idea, however, to himself, and, giving her his arm,
      led her slowly along the path of the shrubbery. &ldquo;You have heard, I
      suppose, what Mr. Farnaby expects of me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I</i> call it worse than mercenary&mdash;I call it downright brutal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Amelius, don&rsquo;t talk so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius came suddenly to a standstill. &ldquo;Does that mean you agree with
      him?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me, dear. I only meant there was some excuse for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What excuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, he has a high idea of your family, and he thought you were
      rich people. And&mdash;I know you didn&rsquo;t mean it, Amelius&mdash;but,
      still, you did disappoint him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius dropped her arm. This mildly-persistent defence of Mr. Farnaby
      exasperated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have disappointed <i>you?&rdquo;</i> he said.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Oh, no, no! Oh, how cruel you are!&rdquo; The ready tears showed themselves
again in her magnificent eyes&mdash;gentle considerate tears that raised
no storm in her bosom, and produced no unbecoming results in her face.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hard on me!&rdquo; she said, appealing to him helplessly, like a
charming overgrown child.
</pre>
    <p>
      Some men might have still resisted her; but Amelius was not one of them.
      He took her hand, and pressed it tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regina,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm round her waist, he concentrated the passion that was in
      him into a look, and poured the look into her eyes. &ldquo;Do you love me as
      dearly as I love you?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt it with all the little passion that was in her. After a moment of
      hesitation, she put one arm timidly round his neck, and, bending her grand
      head, laid it on his bosom. Her finely-rounded, supple, muscular figure
      trembled, as if she had been the most fragile woman living. &ldquo;Dear
      Amelius!&rdquo; she murmured inaudibly. He tried to speak to her&mdash;his voice
      failed him. She had, in perfect innocence, fired his young blood. He drew
      her closer and closer to him: he lifted her head, with a masterful
      resolution which she was not able to resist, and pressed his kisses in hot
      and breathless succession on her lips. His vehemence frightened her. She
      tore herself out of his arms with a sudden exertion of strength that took
      him completely by surprise. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would have been rude to
      me!&rdquo; With that mild reproach, she turned away, and took the path which led
      from the shrubbery to the house. Amelius followed her, entreating that she
      would accept his excuses and grant him a few minutes more. He modestly
      laid all the blame on her beauty&mdash;lamented that he had not resolution
      enough to resist the charm of it. When did that commonplace compliment
      ever fail to produce its effect? Regina smiled with the weakly complacent
      good-nature, which was only saved from being contemptible by its
      association with her personal attractions. &ldquo;Will you promise to behave?&rdquo;
       she stipulated. And Amelius, not very eagerly, promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go into the summer-house?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very damp at this time of year,&rdquo; Regina answered, with placid good
      sense. &ldquo;Perhaps we might catch cold&mdash;we had better walk about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked accordingly. &ldquo;I wanted to speak to you about our marriage,&rdquo;
       Amelius resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed softly. &ldquo;We have some time to wait,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;before we can
      think of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed this reply over without notice. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that I
      have an income of five hundred a year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are hundreds of thousands of respectable artisans, Regina, (with
      large families), who live comfortably on less than half my income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And many gentlemen are not better off. Curates, for instance. Do you see
      what I am coming to, my darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you live with me in a cottage in the country, with a nice garden,
      and one little maid to wait on us, and two or three new dresses in a
      year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina lifted her fine eyes in sober ecstasy to the sky. &ldquo;It sounds very
      tempting,&rdquo; she remarked, in the sweetest tones of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it could all be done,&rdquo; Amelius proceeded, &ldquo;on five hundred a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could it, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have calculated it&mdash;allowing the necessary margin&mdash;and I am
      sure of what I say. And I have done something else; I have asked about the
      Marriage License. I can easily find lodgings in the neighbourhood. We
      might be married at Harrow in a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina started: her eyes opened widely, and rested on Amelius with an
      expression of incredulous wonder. &ldquo;Married in a fortnight?&rdquo; she repeated.
      &ldquo;What would my uncle and aunt say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My angel, our happiness doesn&rsquo;t depend on your uncle and aunt&mdash;our
      happiness depends on ourselves. Nobody has any power to control us. I am a
      man, and you are a woman; and we have a right to be married whenever we
      like.&rdquo; Amelius pronounced this last oracular sentence with his head held
      high, and a pleasant inner persuasion of the convincing manner in which he
      had stated his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without my uncle to give me away!&rdquo; Regina exclaimed. &ldquo;Without my aunt!
      With no bridesmaids, and no friends, and no wedding-breakfast! Oh,
      Amelius, what <i>can</i> you be thinking of?&rdquo; She drew back a step, and
      looked at him in helpless consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, and the moment only, Amelius lost all patience with her.
      &ldquo;If you really loved me,&rdquo; he said bitterly, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t think of the
      bridesmaids and the breakfast!&rdquo; Regina had her answer ready in her pocket&mdash;she
      took out her handkerchief. Before she could lift it to her eyes, Amelius
      recovered himself. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that&mdash;I am sure
      you love me&mdash;take my arm again. Do you know, Regina, I doubt whether
      your uncle has told you everything that passed between us. Are you really
      aware of the hard terms that he insists on? He expects me to increase my
      five hundred a year to two thousand, before he will sanction our
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, he told me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have as much chance of earning fifteen hundred a year, Regina, as I
      have of being made King of England. Did he tell you <i>that?&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t agree with you, dear&mdash;he thinks you might earn it (with
      your abilities) in ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time it was the turn of Amelius to look at Regina in helpless
      consternation. &ldquo;Ten years?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Do you coolly contemplate
      waiting ten years before we are married? Good heavens! is it possible that
      you are thinking of the money? that <i>you</i> can&rsquo;t live without
      carriages and footmen, and ostentation and grandeur&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. For once, even Regina showed that she had spirit enough to be
      angry. &ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself to speak to me in that way!&rdquo;
       she broke out indignantly. &ldquo;If you have no better opinion of me than that,
      I won&rsquo;t marry you at all&mdash;no, not if you had fifty thousand a year,
      sir, to-morrow! Am I to have no sense of duty to my uncle&mdash;to the
      good man who has been a second father to me? Do you think I am ungrateful
      enough to set his wishes at defiance? Oh yes, I know you don&rsquo;t like him! I
      know that a great many people don&rsquo;t like him. That doesn&rsquo;t make any
      difference to Me! But for dear uncle Farnaby, I might have gone to the
      workhouse, I might have been a starving needlewoman, a poor persecuted
      maid-of-all-work. Am I to forget that, because you have no patience, and
      only think of yourself? Oh, I wish I had never met with you! I wish I had
      never been fool enough to be as fond of you as I am!&rdquo; With that
      confession, she turned her back on him, and took refuge in her
      handkerchief once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius stood looking at her in silent despair. After the tone in which
      she had spoken of her obligations to her uncle, it was useless to
      anticipate any satisfactory result from the exertion of his influence over
      Regina. Recalling what he had seen and heard, in Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s room,
      Amelius could not doubt that the motive of pacifying his wife was the
      motive which had first led Farnaby to receive Regina into his house. Was
      it unreasonable or unjust to infer, that the orphan child must have been
      mainly indebted to Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s sense of duty to the memory of her
      sister for the parental protection afforded to her, from that time forth?
      It would have been useless, and worse than useless, to place before Regina
      such considerations as these. Her exaggerated idea of the gratitude that
      she owed to her uncle was beyond the limited reach of reason. Nothing was
      to be gained by opposition; and no sensible course was left but to say
      some peace-making words and submit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Regina, if I have offended you. You have sadly
      disappointed me. I haven&rsquo;t deliberately misjudged you; I can say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned round quickly, and looked at him. There was an ominous change
      to resignation in his voice, there was a dogged submission in his manner,
      that alarmed her. She had never yet seen him under the perilously-patient
      aspect in which he now presented himself, after his apology had been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you, Amelius, with all my heart,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and timidly
      held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it, raised it silently to his lips, and dropped it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly turned pale. All the love that she had in her to give to a
      man, she had given to Amelius. Her heart sank; she asked herself, in blank
      terror, if she had lost him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it is <i>I</i> who have offended <i>you,&rdquo;</i> she said.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me, Amelius! don&rsquo;t make me more unhappy than I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the least angry,&rdquo; he answered, still in the quiet subdued way
      that terrified her. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect me, Regina, to contemplate a ten
      years&rsquo; engagement cheerfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his hand, and held it in both her own hands&mdash;held it, as if
      his love for her was there and she was determined not to let it go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will only leave it to me,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;the engagement shan&rsquo;t be
      so long as that. Try my uncle with a little kindness and respect, Amelius,
      instead of saying hard words to him. Or let <i>me</i> try him, if you are
      too proud to give way. May I say that you had no intention of offending
      him, and that you are willing to leave the future to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Amelius, &ldquo;if you think it will be of the slightest use.&rdquo;
       His tone added plainly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in your uncle, mind, as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still persisted. &ldquo;It will be of the greatest use,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;He
      will let me go home again, and he will not object to your coming to see
      me. He doesn&rsquo;t like to be despised and set at defiance&mdash;who does? Be
      patient, Amelius; and I will persuade him to expect less money from you&mdash;only
      what you may earn, dear, with your talents, long before ten years have
      passed.&rdquo; She waited for a word of reply which might show that she had
      encouraged him a little. He only smiled. &ldquo;You talk of loving me,&rdquo; she
      said, drawing back from him with a look of reproach; &ldquo;and you don&rsquo;t even
      believe what I say to you.&rdquo; She stopped, and looked behind her with a
      faint cry of alarm. Hurried footsteps were audible on the other side of
      the evergreens that screened them. Amelius stepped back to a turn in the
      path, and discovered Phoebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay a moment longer, sir!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to the house&mdash;and
      Mrs. Ormond isn&rsquo;t there&mdash;and nobody knows where she is. Get out by
      the gate, sir, while you have the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius returned to Regina. &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t get the girl into a scrape,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;You know where to write to me. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina made a sign to the maid to retire. Amelius had never taken leave of
      her as he was taking leave of her now. She forgot the fervent embrace and
      the daring kisses&mdash;she was desperate at the bare idea of losing him.
      &ldquo;Oh, Amelius, don&rsquo;t doubt that I love you! Say you believe I love you!
      Kiss me before you go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her&mdash;but, ah, not as he had kissed her before. He said the
      words she wanted him to say&mdash;but only to please her, not with all his
      heart. She let him go; reproaches would be wasted at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe found her pale and immovable, rooted to the spot on which they had
      parted. &ldquo;Dear, dear me, miss, what&rsquo;s gone wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her mistress answered wildly, in words that had never before passed
      her placid lips, &ldquo;O Phoebe, I wish I was dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the impression left on the mind of Regina by the interview in the
      shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression left on the mind of Amelius was stated in equally strong
      language, later in the day. His American friend asked innocently for news,
      and was answered in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find something to occupy my mind, Rufus, or I shall throw the whole thing
      over and go to the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wise man from New England was too wise to trouble Amelius with
      questions, under these circumstances. &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; was all he said. Then
      he put his hand in his pocket, and, producing a letter, laid it quietly on
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me?&rdquo; Amelius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted something to occupy your mind,&rdquo; the wily Rufus answered.
      &ldquo;There &lsquo;tis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius read the letter. It was dated, &ldquo;Hampden Institution.&rdquo; The
      secretary invited Amelius, in highly complimentary terms, to lecture, in
      the hall of the Institution, on Christian Socialism as taught and
      practised in the Community at Tadmor. He was offered two-thirds of the
      profits derived from the sale of places, and was left free to appoint his
      own evening (at a week&rsquo;s notice) and to issue his own advertisements.
      Minor details were reserved to be discussed with the secretary, when the
      lecturer had consented to the arrangement proposed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished the letter, Amelius looked at his friend. &ldquo;This is your
      doing,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus admitted it, with his customary candour. He had a letter of
      introduction to the secretary, and he had called by appointment that
      morning. The Institution wanted something new to attract the members and
      the public. Having no present intention of lecturing himself, he had
      thought of Amelius, and had spoken his thought. &ldquo;I mentioned,&rdquo; Rufus added
      slyly, &ldquo;that I didn&rsquo;t reckon you would mount the platform. But he&rsquo;s a
      sanguine creature, that secretary&mdash;and he said he&rsquo;d try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I say No?&rdquo; Amelius asked, a little irritably. &ldquo;The secretary
      pays me a compliment, and offers me an opportunity of spreading our
      principles. Perhaps,&rdquo; he added, more quietly, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection,
      &ldquo;you thought I might not be equal to the occasion&mdash;and, in that case,
      I don&rsquo;t say you were wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus shook his head. &ldquo;If you had passed your life in this decrepit little
      island,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I might have doubted you, likely enough. But
      Tadmor&rsquo;s situated in the United States. If they don&rsquo;t practise the boys in
      the art of orating, don&rsquo;t you tell me there&rsquo;s an American citizen with a
      voice in <i>that</i> society. Guess again, my son. You won&rsquo;t? Well, then,
      &lsquo;twas uncle Farnaby I had in my mind. I said to myself&mdash;not to the
      secretary&mdash;Amelius is bound to consider uncle Farnaby. Oh, my! what
      would uncle Farnaby say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hot temper of Amelius took fire instantly. &ldquo;What the devil do I care
      for Farnaby&rsquo;s opinions?&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a man in England who
      wants the principles of Christian Socialism beaten into his thick head,
      it&rsquo;s Farnaby. Are you going to see the secretary again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might look in,&rdquo; Rufus answered, &ldquo;in the course of the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;ll give the lecture&mdash;with my compliments and thanks. If I
      can only succeed,&rdquo; pursued Amelius, hearing himself with the new idea, &ldquo;I
      may make a name as a lecturer, and a name means money, and money means
      beating Farnaby with his own weapons. It&rsquo;s an opening for me, Rufus, at
      the crisis of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; Rufus admitted. &ldquo;I may as well look up the secretary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I go with you?&rdquo; Amelius suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Rufus agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the house together.

      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      Late that night Amelius sat alone in his room, making notes for the
      lecture which he had now formally engaged himself to deliver in a week&rsquo;s
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to his American education (as Rufus had supposed), he had not been
      without practice in the art of public speaking. He had learnt to face his
      fellow-creatures in the act of oratory, and to hear the sound of his own
      voice in a silent assembly, without trembling from head to foot. English
      newspapers were regularly sent to Tadmor, and English politics were
      frequently discussed in the little parliament of the Community. The
      prospect of addressing a new audience, with their sympathies probably
      against him at the outset, had its terrors undoubtedly. But the more
      formidable consideration, to the mind of Amelius, was presented by the
      limits imposed on him in the matter of time. The lecture was to be
      succeeded (at the request of a clerical member of the Institution) by a
      public discussion; and the secretary&rsquo;s experience suggested that the
      lecturer would do well to reduce his address within the compass of an
      hour. &ldquo;Socialism is a large subject to be squeezed into that small space,&rdquo;
       Amelius had objected. And the secretary sighed, and answered, &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t
      listen any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Making notes, from time to time, of the points on which it was most
      desirable to insist, and on the relative positions which they should
      occupy in his lecture, the memory of Amelius became more and more absorbed
      in recalling the scenes in which his early life had been passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid down his pen, as the clock of the nearest church struck the first
      dark hour of the morning, and let his thoughts take him back again,
      without interruption or restraint, to the hills and vales of Tadmor. Once
      more the kind old Elder Brother taught him the noble lessons of
      Christianity as they came from the inspired Teacher&rsquo;s own lips; once more
      he took his turn of healthy work in the garden and the field; once more
      the voices of his companions joined with him in the evening songs, and the
      timid little figure of Mellicent stood at his side, content to hold the
      music-book and listen. How poor, how corrupt, did the life look that he
      was leading now, by comparison with the life that he had led in those
      earlier and happier days! How shamefully he had forgotten the simple
      precepts of Christian humility, Christian sympathy, and Christian
      self-restraint, in which his teachers had trusted as the safeguards that
      were to preserve him from the foul contact of the world! Within the last
      two days only, he had refused to make merciful allowance for the errors of
      a man, whose life had been wasted in the sordid struggle upward from
      poverty to wealth. And, worse yet, he had cruelly distressed the poor girl
      who loved him, at the prompting of those selfish passions which it was his
      first and foremost duty to restrain. The bare remembrance of it was
      unendurable to him, in his present frame of mind. With his customary
      impetuosity, he snatched up the pen, to make atonement before he went to
      rest that night. He wrote in few words to Mr. Farnaby, declaring that he
      regretted having spoken impatiently and contemptuously at the interview
      between them, and expressing the hope that their experience of each other,
      in the time to come, might perhaps lead to acceptable concessions on
      either side. His letter to Regina was written, it is needless to say, in
      warmer terms and at much greater length: it was the honest outpouring of
      his love and his penitence. When the letters were safe in their envelopes
      he was not satisfied, even yet. No matter what the hour might be, there
      was no ease of mind for Amelius, until he had actually posted his letters.
      He stole downstairs, and softly unbolted the door, and hurried away to the
      nearest letter-box. When he had let himself in again with his latch-key,
      his mind was relieved at last. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he thought, as he lit his bed-room
      candle, &ldquo;I can go to sleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A visit from Rufus was the first event of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two set to work together to draw out the necessary advertisement of
      the lecture. It was well calculated to attract attention in certain
      quarters. The announcement addressed itself, in capital letters, to all
      honest people who were poor and discontented. &ldquo;Come, and hear the remedy
      which Christian Socialism provides for your troubles, explained to you by
      a friend and a brother; and pay no more than sixpence for the place that
      you occupy.&rdquo; The necessary information as to time and place followed this
      appeal; including the offer of reserved seats at higher prices. By advice
      of the secretary, the advertisement was not sent to any journal having its
      circulation among the wealthier classes of society. It appeared
      prominently in one daily paper and in two weekly papers; the three
      possessing an aggregate sale of four hundred thousand copies. &ldquo;Assume only
      five readers to each copy,&rdquo; cried sanguine Amelius, &ldquo;and we appeal to an
      audience of two millions. What a magnificent publicity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was one inevitable result of magnificent publicity which Amelius
      failed to consider. His advertisements were certain to bring people
      together, who might otherwise never have met in the great world of London,
      under one roof. All over England, Scotland, and Ireland, he invited
      unknown guests to pass the evening with him. In such circumstances,
      recognitions may take place between persons who have lost sight of each
      other for years; conversations may be held, which might otherwise never
      have been exchanged; and results may follow, for which the hero of the
      evening may be innocently responsible, because two or three among his
      audience happen to be sitting to hear him on the same bench. A man who
      opens his doors, and invites the public indiscriminately to come in, runs
      the risk of playing with inflammable materials, and can never be sure at
      what time or in what direction they may explode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus himself took the fair copies of the advertisement to the nearest
      agent. Amelius stayed at home to think over his lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s answer to his letter.
      The man of the oily whiskers wrote courteously and guardedly. He was
      evidently flattered and pleased by the advance that had been made to him;
      and he was quite willing &ldquo;under the circumstances&rdquo; to give the lovers
      opportunities of meeting at his house. At the same time, he limited the
      number of the opportunities. &ldquo;Once a week, for the present, my dear sir.
      Regina will doubtless write to you, when she returns to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina wrote, by return of post. The next morning Amelius received a
      letter from her which enchanted him. She had never loved him as she loved
      him now; she longed to see him again; she had prevailed on Mrs. Ormond to
      let her shorten her visit, and to intercede for her with the authorities
      at home. They were to return together to London on the afternoon of the
      next day. Amelius would be sure to find her, if he arranged to call in
      time for five-o&rsquo;clock tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards four o&rsquo;clock on the next day, while Amelius was putting the
      finishing touches to his dress, he was informed that &ldquo;a young person
      wished to see him.&rdquo; The visitor proved to be Phoebe, with her handkerchief
      to her eyes; indulging in grief, in humble imitation of her young
      mistress&rsquo;s gentle method of proceeding on similar occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Amelius, &ldquo;has anything happened to Regina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; Phoebe murmured behind the handkerchief. &ldquo;Miss Regina is at
      home, and well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what are you crying about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe forgot her mistress&rsquo;s gentle method. She answered, with an
      explosion of sobs, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ruined, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by being ruined? Who&rsquo;s done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius started. His relations with Phoebe had been purely and entirely of
      the pecuniary sort. She was a showy, pretty girl, with a smart little
      figure&mdash;but with some undeniably bad lines, which only observant
      physiognomists remarked, about her eyebrows and her mouth. Amelius was not
      a physiognomist; but he was in love with Regina, which at his age implied
      faithful love. It is only men over forty who can court the mistress, with
      reserves of admiration to spare for the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Amelius; &ldquo;and tell me in two words what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe sat down, and dried her eyes. &ldquo;I have been infamously treated, sir,
      by Mrs. Farnaby,&rdquo; she began&mdash;and stopped, overpowered by the bare
      remembrance of her wrongs. She was angry enough, at that moment, to be off
      her guard. The vindictive nature that was in the girl found its way
      outward, and showed itself in her face. Amelius perceived the change, and
      began to doubt whether Phoebe was quite worthy of the place which she had
      hitherto held in his estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely there must be some mistake,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What opportunity has Mrs.
      Farnaby had of ill-treating you? You have only just got back to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, we got back sooner than we expected. Mrs. Ormond
      had business in town: and she left Miss Regina at her own door, nearly two
      hours since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I had hardly taken off my bonnet and shawl, when I was sent
      for by Mrs. Farnaby. &lsquo;Have you unpacked your box yet?&rsquo; says she. I told
      her I hadn&rsquo;t had time to do so. &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself to unpack,&rsquo; 
      says she. &lsquo;You are no longer in Miss Regina&rsquo;s service. There are your
      wages&mdash;with a month&rsquo;s wages besides, in place of the customary
      warning.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m only a poor girl, sir, but I up and spoke to her as plain as
      she spoke to me. &lsquo;I want to know,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;why I am sent away in this
      uncivil manner?&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t possibly repeat what she said. My blood boils
      when I think of it,&rdquo; Phoebe declared, with melodramatic vehemence.
      &ldquo;Somebody has found us out, sir. Somebody has told Mrs. Farnaby of your
      private meeting with Miss Regina in the shrubbery, and the money you
      kindly gave me. I believe Mrs. Ormond is at the bottom of it; you remember
      nobody knew where she was, when I thought she was in the house speaking to
      the cook. That&rsquo;s guess-work, I allow, so far. What is certain is, that I
      have been spoken to as if I was the lowest creature that walks the
      streets. Mrs. Farnaby refuses to give me a character, sir. She actually
      said she would call in the police, if I didn&rsquo;t leave the house in half an
      hour. How am I to get another place, without a character? I&rsquo;m a ruined
      girl, that&rsquo;s what I am&mdash;and all through You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Threatened at this point with an illustrative outburst of sobbing Amelius
      was simple enough to try the consoling influence of a sovereign. &ldquo;Why
      don&rsquo;t you speak to Miss Regina?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You know she will help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has done all she can, sir. I have nothing to say against Miss Regina&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      a good creature. She came into the room, and begged, and prayed, and took
      all the blame on herself. Mrs. Farnaby wouldn&rsquo;t hear a word. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m mistress
      here,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;you had better go back to your room.&rsquo; Ah, Mr. Amelius, I
      can tell you Mrs. Farnaby is your enemy as well as mine! you&rsquo;ll never
      marry her niece if <i>she</i> can stop it. Mark my words, sir, that&rsquo;s the
      secret of the vile manner in which she has used me. My conscience is
      clear, thank God. I&rsquo;ve tried to serve the cause of true love&mdash;and I&rsquo;m
      not ashamed of it. Never mind! my turn is to come. I&rsquo;m only a poor
      servant, sent adrift in the world without a character. Wait a little! you
      see if I am not even (and better than even) with Mrs. Farnaby, before
      long! <i>I know what I know.</i> I am not going to say any more than that.
      She shall rue the day,&rdquo; cried Phoebe, relapsing into melodrama again,
      &ldquo;when she turned me out of the house like a thief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; said Amelius, sharply, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t speak in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe had got her money: she could afford to be independent. She rose
      from her chair. The insolence which is the almost invariable accompaniment
      of a sense of injury among Englishwomen of her class expressed itself in
      her answer to Amelius. &ldquo;I speak as I think, sir. I have some spirit in me;
      I am not a woman to be trodden underfoot&mdash;and so Mrs. Farnaby shall
      find, before she is many days older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phoebe! Phoebe! you are talking like a heathen. If Mrs. Farnaby has
      behaved to you with unjust severity, set her an example of moderation on
      your side. It&rsquo;s your duty as a Christian to forgive injuries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe burst out laughing. &ldquo;Hee-hee-hee! Thank you, sir, for a sermon as
      well as a sovereign. You have been most kind, indeed!&rdquo; She changed
      suddenly from irony to anger. &ldquo;I never was called a heathen before!
      Considering what I have done for you, I think you might at least have been
      civil. Good afternoon, sir.&rdquo; She lifted her saucy little snub-nose, and
      walked with dignity out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, Amelius was amused. As he heard the house-door closed, he
      turned laughing to the window, for a last look at Phoebe in the character
      of an injured Christian. In an instant the smile left his lips&mdash;he
      drew back from the window with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man had been waiting for Phoebe, in the street. At the moment when
      Amelius looked out, she had just taken his arm. He glanced back at the
      house, as they walked away together. Amelius immediately recognised, in
      Phoebe&rsquo;s companion (and sweetheart), a vagabond Irishman, nicknamed Jervy,
      whose face he had last seen at Tadmor. Employed as one of the agents of
      the Community in transacting their business with the neighbouring town, he
      had been dismissed for misconduct, and had been unwisely taken back again,
      at the intercession of a respectable person who believed in his promises
      of amendment. Amelius had suspected this man of being the spy who
      officiously informed against Mellicent and himself, but having discovered
      no evidence to justify his suspicions, he had remained silent on the
      subject. It was now quite plain to him that Jervy&rsquo;s appearance in London
      could only be attributed to a second dismissal from the service of the
      Community, for some offence sufficiently serious to oblige him to take
      refuge in England. A more disreputable person it was hardly possible for
      Phoebe to have become acquainted with. In her present vindictive mood, he
      would be emphatically a dangerous companion and counsellor. Amelius felt
      this so strongly, that he determined to follow them, on the chance of
      finding out where Jervy lived. Unhappily, he had only arrived at this
      resolution after a lapse of a minute or two. He ran into the street but it
      was too late; not a trace of them was to be discovered. Pursuing his way
      to Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s house, he decided on mentioning what had happened to
      Regina. Her aunt had not acted wisely in refusing to let the maid refer to
      her for a character. She would do well to set herself right with Phoebe,
      in this particular, before it was too late.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby stood at the door of her own room, and looked at her niece
      with an air of contemptuous curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? You and your lover have had a fine time of it together, I suppose?
      What do you want here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amelius wishes particularly to speak to you, aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him to save himself the trouble. He may reconcile your uncle to his
      marriage&mdash;he won&rsquo;t reconcile Me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about that, aunt; it&rsquo;s about Phoebe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he want me to take Phoebe back again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Amelius appeared in the hall, and answered the question
      himself. &ldquo;I want to give you a word of warning,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby smiled grimly. &ldquo;That excites my curiosity,&rdquo; she replied.
      &ldquo;Come in. I don&rsquo;t want <i>you,&rdquo;</i> she added, dismissing her niece at the
      door. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re willing to wait ten years for Regina?&rdquo; she continued,
      when Amelius was alone with her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed in you; you&rsquo;re a poor
      weak creature, after all. What about that young hussy, Phoebe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius told her unreservedly all that had passed between the discarded
      maid and himself, not forgetting, before he concluded, to caution her on
      the subject of the maid&rsquo;s companion. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that man may not
      do to mislead Phoebe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t drive her into
      a corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby eyed him scornfully from head to foot. &ldquo;You used to have the
      spirit of a man in you,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Keeping company with Regina has
      made you a milksop already. If you want to know what I think of Phoebe and
      her sweetheart&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped, and snapped her fingers. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I think! Now go back to Regina. I can tell you one
      thing&mdash;she will never be your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked at her in quiet surprise. &ldquo;It seems odd,&rdquo; he remarked,
      &ldquo;that you should treat me as you do, after what you said to me, the last
      time I was in this room. You expect me to help you in the dearest wish of
      your life&mdash;and you do everything you can to thwart the dearest wish
      of <i>my</i> life. A man can&rsquo;t keep his temper under continual
      provocation. Suppose I refuse to help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby looked at him with the most exasperating composure. &ldquo;I defy
      you to do it,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You defy me to do it!&rdquo; Amelius exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you take me for a fool?&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby went on. &ldquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t
      know you better than you know yourself?&rdquo; She stepped up close to him; her
      voice sank suddenly to low and tender tones. &ldquo;If that last unlikely chance
      should turn out in my favour,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;if you really did meet with
      my poor girl, one of these days, and knew that you had met with her&mdash;do
      you mean to say you could be cruel enough, no matter how badly I behaved
      to you, to tell me nothing about it? Is <i>that</i> the heart I can feel
      beating under my hand? Is <i>that</i> the Christianity you learnt at
      Tadmor? Pooh, pooh, you foolish boy! Go back to Regina; and tell her you
      have tried to frighten me, and you find it won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day was Saturday. The advertisement of the lecture appeared in
      the newspapers. Rufus confessed that he had been extravagant enough, in
      the case of the two weekly journals, to occupy half a page. &ldquo;The public,&rdquo;
       he explained, &ldquo;have got a nasty way of overlooking advertisements of a
      modest and retiring character. Hit &lsquo;em in the eyes when they open the
      paper, or you don&rsquo;t hit &lsquo;em at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Among the members of the public attracted by the new announcement, Mrs.
      Farnaby was one. She honoured Amelius with a visit at his lodgings. &ldquo;I
      called you a poor weak creature yesterday&rdquo; (these were her first words on
      entering the room); &ldquo;I talked like a fool. You&rsquo;re a splendid fellow; I
      respect your courage, and I shall attend your lecture. Never mind what Mr.
      Farnaby and Regina say. Regina&rsquo;s poor little conventional soul is shaken,
      I dare say; you needn&rsquo;t expect to have my niece among your audience. But
      Farnaby is a humbug, as usual. He affects to be horrified; he talks big
      about breaking off the match. In his own self, he&rsquo;s bursting with
      curiosity to know how you will get through with it. I tell you this&mdash;he
      will sneak into the hall and stand at the back where nobody can see him. I
      shall go with him; and, when you&rsquo;re on the platform, I&rsquo;ll hold up my
      handkerchief like this. Then you&rsquo;ll know he&rsquo;s there. Hit him hard, Amelius&mdash;hit
      him hard! Where is your friend Rufus? just gone away? I like that
      American. Give him my love, and tell him to come and see me.&rdquo; She left the
      room as abruptly as she had entered it. Amelius looked after her in
      amazement. Mrs. Farnaby was not like herself; Mrs. Farnaby was in good
      spirits!
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina&rsquo;s opinion of the lecture arrived by post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every other word in her letter was underlined; half the sentences began
      with &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;; Regina was shocked, astonished, ashamed, alarmed. What would
      Amelius do next? Why had he deceived her, and left her to find it out in
      the papers? He had undone all the good effect of those charming letters to
      her father and herself. He had no idea of the disgust and abhorrence which
      respectable people would feel at his odious Socialism. Was she never to
      know another happy moment? and was Amelius to be the cause of it? and so
      on, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s protest followed, delivered by Mr. Farnaby himself. He kept
      his gloves on when he called; he was solemn and pathetic; he remonstrated,
      in the character of one of the ancestors of Amelius; he pitied the ancient
      family &ldquo;mouldering in the silent grave,&rdquo; he would abstain from deciding in
      a hurry, but his daughter&rsquo;s feelings were outraged, and he feared it might
      be his duty to break off the match. Amelius, with perfect good temper,
      offered him a free admission, and asked him to hear the lecture and decide
      for himself whether there was any harm in it. Mr. Farnaby turned his head
      away from the ticket as if it was something indecent. &ldquo;Sad! sad!&rdquo; That was
      his only farewell to the gentleman-Socialist.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Sunday (being the only day in London on which a man can use his
      brains without being interrupted by street music), Amelius rehearsed his
      lecture. On the Monday, he paid his weekly visit to Regina.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was reported&mdash;whether truly or not it was impossible for him to
      discover&mdash;to have gone out in the carriage with Mrs. Ormond. Amelius
      wrote to her in soothing and affectionate terms, suggesting, as he had
      suggested to her father, that she should wait to hear the lecture before
      she condemned it. In the mean time, he entreated her to remember that they
      had promised to be true to one another, in time and eternity&mdash;Socialism
      notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer came back by private messenger. The tone was serious. Regina&rsquo;s
      principles forbade her to attend a Socialist lecture. She hoped Amelius
      was in earnest in writing as he did about time and eternity. The subject
      was very awful to a rightly-constituted mind. On the next page, some
      mitigation of this severity followed in a postscript. Regina would wait at
      home to see Amelius, the day after his &ldquo;regrettable appearance in public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evening of Tuesday was the evening of the lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus posted himself at the ticket-taker&rsquo;s office, in the interests of
      Amelius. &ldquo;Even sixpences do sometimes stick to a man&rsquo;s fingers, on their
      way from the public to the money-box,&rdquo; he remarked. The sixpences did
      indeed flow in rapidly; the advertisements had, so far, produced their
      effect. But the reserved seats sold very slowly. The members of the
      Institution, who were admitted for nothing, arrived in large numbers, and
      secured the best places. Towards eight o&rsquo;clock (the hour at which the
      lecture was to begin), the sixpenny audience was still pouring in. Rufus
      recognised Phoebe among the late arrivals, escorted by a person in the
      dress of a gentleman, who was palpably a blackguard nevertheless. A short
      stout lady followed, who warily shook hands with Rufus, and said, &ldquo;Let me
      introduce you to Mr. Farnaby.&rdquo; Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s mouth and chin were shrouded
      in a wrapper; his hat was over his eyebrows. Rufus observed that he looked
      as if he was ashamed of himself. A gaunt, dirty, savage old woman,
      miserably dressed, offered her sixpence to the moneytaker, while the two
      gentlemen were shaking hands; the example, it is needless to say, being
      set by Rufus. The old woman looked attentively at all that was visible of
      Mr. Farnaby&mdash;that is to say, at his eyes and his whiskers&mdash;by
      the gas-lamp hanging in the corridor. She instantly drew back, though she
      had got her ticket; waited until Mr. Farnaby had paid for his wife and
      himself, and then followed close behind them, into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why not? The advertisements addressed this wretched old creature as
      one of the poor and discontented public. Sixteen years ago, John Farnaby
      had put his own child into that woman&rsquo;s hands at Ramsgate, and had never
      seen either of them since.

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      Entering the hall, Mr. Farnaby discovered without difficulty the position
      of modest retirement of which he was in search.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cheap seats were situated, as usual, on that part of the floor of the
      building which was farthest from the platform. A gallery at this end of
      the hall threw its shadow over the hindermost benches and the gangway by
      which they were approached. In the sheltering obscurity thus produced, Mr.
      Farnaby took his place; standing in the corner formed by the angle it
      which the two walls of the building met, with his dutiful wife at his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still following them, unnoticed in the crowd, the old woman stopped at the
      extremity of the hindermost bench, looked close at a smartly-dressed young
      man who occupied the last seat at the end, and who paid marked attention
      to a pretty girl sitting by him, and whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Now then,
      Jervy! can&rsquo;t you make room for Mother Sowler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man started and looked round. &ldquo;You here?&rdquo; he exclaimed, with an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could say more, Phoebe whispered to him on the other side, &ldquo;What
      a horrid old creature! How did you ever come to know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, Mrs. Sowler reiterated her request in more peremptory
      language. &ldquo;Do you hear, Jervy&mdash;do you hear? Sit a little closer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy apparently had his reasons for treating the expression of Mrs.
      Sowler&rsquo;s wishes with deference, shabby as she was. Making abundant
      apologies, he asked his neighbours to favour him by sitting a little
      nearer to each other, and so contrive to leave a morsel of vacant space at
      the edge of the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe, making room under protest, began to whisper again. &ldquo;What does she
      mean by calling you Jervy? She looks like a beggar. Tell her your name is
      Jervis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply she received did not encourage her to say more. &ldquo;Hold your
      tongue; I have reasons for being civil to her&mdash;you be civil too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Mrs. Sowler, with the readiest submission to circumstances.
      Under the surface of his showy looks and his vulgar facility of manner,
      there lay hidden a substance of callous villainy and impenetrable cunning.
      He had in him the materials out of which the clever murderers are made,
      who baffle the police. If he could have done it with impunity, he would
      have destroyed without remorse the squalid old creature who sat by him,
      and who knew enough of his past career in England to send him to penal
      servitude for life. As it was, he spoke to her with a spurious
      condescension and good humour. &ldquo;Why, it must be ten years, Mrs. Sowler,
      since I last saw you! What have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman frowned at him as she answered. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you look at me, and see?
      Starving!&rdquo; She eyed his gaudy watch and chain greedily. &ldquo;Money don&rsquo;t seem
      to be scarce with you. Have you made your fortune in America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hand on her arm, and pressed it warningly. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he said,
      under his breath. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that, after the lecture.&rdquo; His bright
      shifty black eyes turned furtively towards Phoebe&mdash;and Mrs. Sowler
      noticed it. The girl&rsquo;s savings in service had paid for his jewelry and his
      fine clothes. She silently resented his rudeness in telling her to &ldquo;hold
      her tongue&rdquo;; sitting, sullen, with her impudent little nose in the air.
      Jervy tried to include her indirectly in his conversation with his shabby
      old friend. &ldquo;This young lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;knows Mr. Goldenheart. She feels
      sure he&rsquo;ll break down; and we&rsquo;ve come here to see the fun. I don&rsquo;t hold
      with Socialism myself&mdash;I am for, what my favourite newspaper calls,
      the Altar and the Throne. In short, my politics are Conservative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your politics are in your girl&rsquo;s pocket,&rdquo; muttered Mrs. Sowler. &ldquo;How long
      will her money last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy turned a deaf ear to the interruption. &ldquo;And what has brought you
      here?&rdquo; he went on, in his most ingratiating way. &ldquo;Did you see the
      advertisement in the papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler answered loud enough to be heard above the hum of talking in
      the sixpenny places. &ldquo;I was having a drop of gin, and I saw the paper at
      the public-house. I&rsquo;m one of the discontented poor. I hate rich people;
      and I&rsquo;m ready to pay my sixpence to hear them abused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; said a man near, who looked like a shoemaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll give it to the aristocracy,&rdquo; added one of the shoemaker&rsquo;s
      neighbours, apparently a groom out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of the aristocracy,&rdquo; cried a woman with a fiery face and a
      crushed bonnet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s them as swallows up the money. What business have
      they with their palaces and their parks, when my husband&rsquo;s out of work,
      and my children hungry at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The acquiescent shoemaker listened with admiration. &ldquo;Very well put,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;very well put.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These expressions of popular feeling reached the respectable ears of Mr.
      Farnaby. &ldquo;Do you hear those wretches?&rdquo; he said to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby seized the welcome opportunity of irritating him. &ldquo;Poor
      things!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;In their place, we should talk as they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go into the reserved seats,&rdquo; rejoined her husband, turning
      from her with a look of disgust. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of room. Why do you stop
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of leaving you, my dear! How did you like my American
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am astonished at your taking the liberty of introducing him to me. You
      knew perfectly well that I was here incognito. What do I care about a
      wandering American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby persisted as maliciously as ever. &ldquo;Ah, but you see, I like
      him. The wandering American is my ally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ally! What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, how dull you are! don&rsquo;t you know that I object to my
      niece&rsquo;s marriage engagement? I was quite delighted when I heard of this
      lecture, because it&rsquo;s an obstacle in the way. It disgusts Regina, and it
      disgusts You&mdash;and my dear American is the man who first brought it
      about. Hush! here&rsquo;s Amelius. How well he looks! So graceful and so
      gentlemanlike,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Farnaby, signalling with her handkerchief to
      show Amelius their position in the hall. &ldquo;I declare I&rsquo;m ready to become a
      Socialist before he opens his lips!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The personal appearance of Amelius took the audience completely by
      surprise. A man who is young and handsome is not the order of man who is
      habitually associated in the popular mind with the idea of a lecture.
      After a moment of silence, there was a spontaneous burst of applause. It
      was renewed when Amelius, first placing on his table a little book,
      announced his intention of delivering the lecture extempore. The absence
      of the inevitable manuscript was in itself an act of mercy that cheered
      the public at starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orator of the evening began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, thoughtful people accustomed to watch the signs of
      the times in this country, and among the other nations of Europe, are (so
      far as I know) agreed in the conclusion, that serious changes are likely
      to take place in present forms of government, and in existing systems of
      society, before the century in which we live has reached its end. In plain
      words, the next revolution is not so unlikely, and not so far off, as it
      pleases the higher and wealthier classes among European populations to
      suppose. I am one of those who believe that the coming convulsion will
      take the form, this time, of a social revolution, and that the man at the
      head of it will not be a military or a political man&mdash;but a Great
      Citizen, sprung from the people, and devoted heart and soul to the
      people&rsquo;s cause. Within the limits assigned to me to-night, it is
      impossible that I should speak to you of government and society among
      other nations, even if I possessed the necessary knowledge and experience
      to venture on so vast a subject. All that I can now attempt to do is
      (first) to point out some of the causes which are paving the way for a
      coming change in the social and political condition of this country; and
      (secondly) to satisfy you that the only trustworthy remedy for existing
      abuses is to be found in the system which Christian Socialism extracts
      from this little book on my table&mdash;the book which you all know under
      the name of The New Testament. Before, however, I enter on my task, I feel
      it a duty to say one preliminary word on the subject of my claim to
      address you, such as it is. I am most unwilling to speak of myself&mdash;but
      my position here forces me to do so. I am a stranger to all of you; and I
      am a very young man. Let me tell you, then, briefly, what my life has
      been, and where I have been brought up&mdash;and then decide for
      yourselves whether it is worth your while to favour me with your
      attention, or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good opening,&rdquo; remarked the shoemaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice-looking fellow,&rdquo; said the fiery-faced woman, &ldquo;I should like to
      kiss him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too civil by half,&rdquo; grumbled Mrs. Sowler; &ldquo;I wish I had my sixpence
      back in my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him time.&rdquo; whispered Jervy, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;ll warm up. I say, Phoebe, he
      doesn&rsquo;t begin like a man who is going to break down. I don&rsquo;t expect there
      will be much to laugh at to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an admirable speaker!&rdquo; said Mrs. Farnaby to her husband. &ldquo;Fancy such
      a man as that, being married to such an idiot as Regina!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a chance for him,&rdquo; returned Mr. Farnaby, savagely, &ldquo;as
      long as he&rsquo;s not married to such a woman as You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, Amelius had claimed national kindred with his audience
      as an Englishman, and had rapidly sketched his life at Tadmor, in its most
      noteworthy points. This done, he put the question whether they would hear
      him. His frankness and freshness had already won the public: they answered
      by a general shout of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Amelius proceeded, &ldquo;now let us get on. Suppose we take a
      glance (we have no time to do more) at the present state of our religious
      system, first. What is the public aspect of the thing called Christianity,
      in the England of our day? A hundred different sects all at variance with
      each other. An established church, rent in every direction by incessant
      wrangling&mdash;disputes about black gowns or white; about having
      candlesticks on tables, or off tables; about bowing to the east or bowing
      to the west; about which doctrine collects the most respectable support
      and possesses the largest sum of money, the doctrine in my church, or the
      doctrine in your church, or the doctrine in the church over the way. Look
      up, if you like, from this multitudinous and incessant squabbling among
      the rank and file, to the high regions in which the right reverend
      representatives of state religion sit apart. Are they Christians? If they
      are, show me the Bishop who dare assert his Christianity in the House of
      Lords, when the ministry of the day happens to see its advantage in
      engaging in a war! Where is that Bishop, and how many supporters does he
      count among his own order? Do you blame me for using intemperate language&mdash;language
      which I cannot justify? Take a fair test, and try me by that. The result
      of the Christianity of the New Testament is to make men true, humane,
      gentle, modest, strictly scrupulous and strictly considerate in their
      dealings with their neighbours. Does the Christianity of the churches and
      the sects produce these results among us? Look at the staple of the
      country, at the occupation which employs the largest number of Englishmen
      of all degrees&mdash;Look at our Commerce. What is its social aspect,
      judged by the morality which is in this book in my hand? Let those
      organised systems of imposture, masquerading under the disguise of banks
      and companies, answer the question&mdash;there is no need for me to answer
      it. You know what respectable names are associated, year after year, with
      the shameless falsification of accounts, and the merciless ruin of
      thousands on thousands of victims. You know how our poor Indian customer
      finds his cotton-print dress a sham that falls to pieces; how the savage
      who deals honestly with us for his weapon finds his gun a delusion that
      bursts; how the half-starved needlewoman who buys her reel of thread finds
      printed on the label a false statement of the number of yards that she
      buys; you know that, in the markets of Europe, foreign goods are fast
      taking the place of English goods, because the foreigner is the most
      honest manufacturer of the two&mdash;and, lastly, you know, what is worse
      than all, that these cruel and wicked deceptions, and many more like them,
      are regarded, on the highest commercial authority, as &lsquo;forms of
      competition&rsquo; and justifiable proceedings in trade. Do you believe in the
      honourable accumulation of wealth by men who hold such opinions and
      perpetrate such impostures as these? I don&rsquo;t! Do you find any brighter and
      purer prospect when you look down from the man who deceives you and me on
      the great scale, to the man who deceives us on the small? I don&rsquo;t!
      Everything we eat, drink, and wear is a more or less adulterated
      commodity; and that very adulteration is sold to us by the tradesmen at
      such outrageous prices, that we are obliged to protect ourselves on the
      Socialist principle, by setting up cooperative shops of our own. Wait! and
      hear me out, before you applaud. Don&rsquo;t mistake the plain purpose of what I
      am saying to you; and don&rsquo;t suppose that I am blind to the brighter side
      of the dark picture that I have drawn. Look within the limits of private
      life, and you will find true Christians, thank God, among clergymen and
      laymen alike; you will find men and women who deserve to be called, in the
      highest sense of the word, disciples of Christ. But my business is not
      with private life&mdash;my business is with the present public aspect of
      the religion, morals, and politics of this country; and again I say it,
      that aspect presents one wide field of corruption and abuse, and reveals a
      callous and shocking insensibility on the part of the nation at large to
      the spectacle of its own demoralisation and disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There Amelius paused, and took his first drink of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reserved seats at public performances seem, by some curious affinity, to
      be occupied by reserved persons. The select public, seated nearest to the
      orator, preserved discreet silence. But the hearty applause from the
      sixpenny places made ample amends. There was enough of the lecturer&rsquo;s own
      vehemence and impetuosity in this opening attack&mdash;sustained as it
      undeniably was by a sound foundation of truth&mdash;to appeal strongly to
      the majority of his audience. Mrs. Sowler began to think that her sixpence
      had been well laid out, after all; and Mrs. Farnaby pointed the direct
      application to her husband of all the hardest hits at commerce, by nodding
      her head at him as they were delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next thing we have to discover is this: Will our present system of
      government supply us with peaceable means for the reform of the abuses
      which I have already noticed? not forgetting that other enormous abuse,
      represented by our intolerable national expenditure, increasing with every
      year. Unless you insist on it, I do not propose to waste our precious time
      by saying anything about the House of Lords, for three good reasons. In
      the first place, that assembly is not elected by the people, and it has
      therefore no right of existence in a really free country. In the second
      place, out of its four hundred and eighty-five members, no less than one
      hundred and eighty-four directly profit by the expenditure of the public
      money; being in the annual receipt, under one pretence or another, of more
      than half a million sterling. In the third place, if the assembly of the
      Commons has in it the will, as well as the capacity, to lead the way in
      the needful reforms, the assembly of the Lords has no alternative but to
      follow, or to raise the revolution which it only escaped, by a
      hair&rsquo;s-breadth, some forty years since. What do you say? Shall we waste
      our time in speaking of the House of Lords?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loud cries from the sixpenny benches answered No; the ostler and the
      fiery-faced woman being the most vociferous of all. Here and there,
      certain dissentient individuals raised a little hiss&mdash;led by Jervy,
      in the interests of &ldquo;the Altar and the Throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, will the House of Commons help us to get purer Christianity, and
      cheaper government, by lawful and sufficient process of reform? Let me
      again remind you that this assembly has the power&mdash;if it has the
      will. Is it so constituted at present as to have the will? There is the
      question! The number of members is a little over six hundred and fifty.
      Out of this muster, one fifth only represent (or pretend to represent) the
      trading interests of the country. As for the members charged with the
      interests of the working class, they are more easily counted still&mdash;they
      are two in number! Then, in heaven&rsquo;s name (you will ask), what interest
      does the majority of members in this assembly represent? There is but one
      answer&mdash;the military and aristocratic interest. In these days of the
      decay of representative institutions, the House of Commons has become a
      complete misnomer. The Commons are not represented; modern members belong
      to classes of the community which have really no interest in providing for
      popular needs and lightening popular burdens. In one word, there is no
      sort of hope for us in the House of Commons. And whose fault is this? I
      own it with shame and sorrow&mdash;it is emphatically the fault of the
      people. Yes, I say to you plainly, it is the disgrace and the peril of
      England that the people themselves have elected the representative
      assembly which ignores the people&rsquo;s wants! You voters, in town and county
      alike, have had every conceivable freedom and encouragement secured to you
      in the exercise of your sacred trust&mdash;and there is the modern House
      of Commons to prove that you are thoroughly unworthy of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These bold words produced an outbreak of disapprobation from the audience,
      which, for the moment, completely overpowered the speaker&rsquo;s voice. They
      were prepared to listen with inexhaustible patience to the enumeration of
      their virtues and their wrongs&mdash;but they had not paid sixpence each
      to be informed of the vicious and contemptible part which they play in
      modern politics. They yelled and groaned and hissed&mdash;and felt that
      their handsome young lecturer had insulted them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius waited quietly until the disturbance had worn itself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I have made you angry with me,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;The blame
      for this little disturbance really rests with the public speakers who are
      afraid of you and who flatter you&mdash;especially if you belong to the
      working classes. You are not accustomed to have the truth told you to your
      faces. Why, my good friends, the people in this country, who are unworthy
      of the great trust which the wise and generous English constitution places
      in their hands, are so numerous that they can be divided into distinct
      classes! There is the highly-educated class which despairs, and holds
      aloof. There is the class beneath&mdash;without self-respect, and
      therefore without public spirit&mdash;which can be bribed indirectly, by
      the gift of a place, by the concession of a lease, even by an invitation
      to a party at a great house which includes the wives and the daughters.
      And there is the lower class still&mdash;mercenary, corrupt, shameless to
      the marrow of its bones&mdash;which sells itself and its liberties for
      money and drink. When I began this discourse, and adverted to great
      changes that are to come, I spoke of them as revolutionary changes. Am I
      an alarmist? Do I unjustly ignore the capacity for peaceable reformation
      which has preserved modern England from revolutions, thus far? God forbid
      that I should deny the truth, or that I should alarm you without need! But
      history tells me, if I look no farther back than to the first French
      Revolution, that there are social and political corruptions, which strike
      their roots in a nation so widely and so deeply, that no force short of
      the force of a revolutionary convulsion can tear them up and cast them
      away. And I do personally fear (and older and wiser men than I agree with
      me), that the corruptions at which I have only been able to hint, in this
      brief address, are fast extending themselves&mdash;in England, as well as
      in Europe generally&mdash;beyond the reach of that lawful and bloodless
      reform which has served us so well in past years. Whether I am mistaken in
      this view (and I hope with all my heart it may be so), or whether events
      yet in the future will prove that I am right, the remedy in either case,
      the one sure foundation on which a permanent, complete, and worthy
      reformation can be built&mdash;whether it prevents a convulsion or whether
      it follows a convulsion&mdash;is only to be found within the covers of
      this book. Do not, I entreat you, suffer yourselves to be persuaded by
      those purblind philosophers who assert that the divine virtue of
      Christianity is a virtue which is wearing out with the lapse of time. It
      is the abuse and corruption of Christianity that is wearing out&mdash;as
      all falsities and all impostures must and do wear out. Never, since Christ
      and his apostles first showed men the way to be better and happier, have
      the nations stood in sorer need of a return to that teaching, in its
      pristine purity and simplicity, than now! Never, more certainly than at
      this critical time, was it the interest as well as the duty of mankind to
      turn a deaf ear to the turmoil of false teachers, and to trust in that
      all-wise and all-merciful Voice which only ceased to exalt, console, and
      purify humanity, when it expired in darkness under the torture of the
      cross! Are these the wild words of an enthusiast? Is this the dream of an
      earthly Paradise in which it is sheer folly to believe? I can tell you of
      one existing community (one among others) which numbers some hundreds of
      persons; and which has found prosperity and happiness, by reducing the
      whole art and mystery of government to the simple solution set forth in
      the New Testament&mdash;fear God, and love thy neighbour as thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By these gradations Amelius arrived at the second of the two parts into
      which he had divided his address.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now repeated, at greater length and with a more careful choice of
      language, the statement of the religious and social principles of the
      Community at Tadmor, which he had already addressed to his two
      fellow-travellers on the voyage to England. While he confined himself to
      plain narrative, describing a mode of life which was entirely new to his
      hearers, he held the attention of the audience. But when he began to argue
      the question of applying Christian Socialism to the government of large
      populations as well as small&mdash;when he inquired logically whether what
      he had proved to be good for some hundreds of persons was not also good
      for some thousands, and, conceding that, for some hundreds of thousands,
      and so on until he had arrived, by dint of sheer argument, at the
      conclusion that what had succeeded at Tadmor must necessarily succeed on a
      fair trial in London&mdash;then the public interest began to flag. People
      remembered their coughs and colds, and talked in whispers, and looked
      about them with a vague feeling of relief in staring at each other. Mrs.
      Sowler, hitherto content with furtively glancing at Mr. Farnaby from time
      to time, now began to look at him more boldly, as he stood in his corner
      with his eyes fixed sternly on the platform at the other end of the hall.
      He too began to feel that the lecture was changing its tone. It was no
      longer the daring outbreak which he had come to hear, as his sufficient
      justification (if necessary) for forbidding Amelius to enter his house. &ldquo;I
      have had enough of it,&rdquo; he said, suddenly turning to his wife, &ldquo;let us
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Mrs. Farnaby could have been forewarned that she was standing in that
      assembly of strangers, not as one of themselves, but as a woman with a
      formidable danger hanging over her head&mdash;or if she had only happened
      to look towards Phoebe, and had felt a passing reluctance to submit
      herself to the possibly insolent notice of a discharged servant&mdash;she
      might have gone out with her husband, and might have so escaped the peril
      that had been lying in wait for her, from the fatal moment when she first
      entered the hall. As it was she refused to move. &ldquo;You forget the public
      discussion,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Wait and see what sort of fight Amelius makes of
      it when the lecture is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke loud enough to be heard by some of the people seated nearest to
      her. Phoebe, critically examining the dresses of the few ladies in the
      reserved seats, twisted round on the bench, and noticed for the first time
      the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Farnaby in their dim corner. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she
      whispered to Jervy, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the wretch who turned me out of her house
      without a character, and her husband with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy looked round, in his turn, a little doubtful of the accuracy of his
      sweetheart&rsquo;s information. &ldquo;Surely they wouldn&rsquo;t come to the sixpenny
      places,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Are you certain it&rsquo;s Mr. and Mrs. Farnaby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in cautiously-lowered tones; but Mrs. Sowler had seen him look
      back at the lady and gentleman in the corner, and was listening
      attentively to catch the first words that fell from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is Mr. Farnaby?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man in the corner there, with the white silk wrapper over his mouth,
      and his hat down to his eyebrows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler looked round for a moment&mdash;to make sure that Jervy&rsquo;s man
      and her man were one and the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farnaby?&rdquo; she muttered to herself, in the tone of a person who heard the
      name for the first time. She considered a little, and leaning across
      Jervy, addressed herself to his companion. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;did
      that gentleman ever go by the name of Morgan, and have his letters
      addressed to the George and Dragon, in Tooley-street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe lifted her eyebrows with a look of contemptuous surprise, which was
      an answer in itself. &ldquo;Fancy the great Mr. Farnaby going by an assumed
      name, and having his letters addressed to a public-house!&rdquo; she said to
      Jervy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler asked no more questions. She relapsed into muttering to
      herself, under her breath. &ldquo;His whiskers have turned gray, to be sure&mdash;but
      I know his eyes again; I&rsquo;ll take my oath to it, there&rsquo;s no mistaking <i>his</i>
      eyes!&rdquo; She suddenly appealed to Jervy. &ldquo;Is Mr. Farnaby rich?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rolling in riches!&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy was cautious how he replied to that; he consulted Phoebe. &ldquo;Shall I
      tell her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe answered petulantly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m turned out of the house; I don&rsquo;t care
      what you tell her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy again addressed the old woman, still keeping his information in
      reserve. &ldquo;Why do you want to know where he lives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He owes me money,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sowler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jervy looked hard at her, and emitted a long low whistle, expressive of
      blank amazement. The persons near, annoyed by the incessant whispering,
      looked round irritably, and insisted on silence. Jervy ventured
      nevertheless on a last interruption. &ldquo;You seem to be tired of this,&rdquo; he
      remarked to Phoebe; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go and get some oysters.&rdquo; She rose directly.
      Jervy tapped Mrs. Sowler on the shoulder, as they passed her. &ldquo;Come and
      have some supper,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand treat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three were necessarily noticed by their neighbours as they passed out.
      Mrs. Farnaby discovered Phoebe&mdash;when it was too late. Mr. Farnaby
      happened to look first at the old woman. Sixteen years of squalid poverty
      effectually disguised her, in that dim light. He only looked away again,
      and said to his wife impatiently, &ldquo;Let us go too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby was still obstinate. &ldquo;You can go if you like,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I
      shall stay here.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three dozen oysters, bread-and-butter, and bottled stout; a private room
      and a good fire.&rdquo; Issuing these instructions, on his arrival at the
      tavern, Jervy was surprised by a sudden act of interference on the part of
      his venerable guest. Mrs. Sowler actually took it on herself to order her
      own supper!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing cold to eat or drink for me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Morning and night,
      waking and sleeping, I can&rsquo;t keep myself warm. See for yourself, Jervy,
      how I&rsquo;ve lost flesh since you first knew me! A steak, broiling hot from
      the gridiron, and gin-and-water, hotter still&mdash;that&rsquo;s the supper for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the order, waiter,&rdquo; said Jervy, resignedly; &ldquo;and let us see the
      private room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tavern was of the old-fashioned English sort, which scorns to learn a
      lesson of brightness and elegance from France. The private room can only
      be described as a museum for the exhibition of dirt in all its varieties.
      Behind the bars of the rusty little grate a dying fire was drawing its
      last breath. Mrs. Sowler clamoured for wood and coals; revived the fire
      with her own hands; and seated herself shivering as close to the fender as
      the chair would go. After a while, the composing effect of the heat began
      to make its influence felt: the head of the half-starved wretch sank: a
      species of stupor overcame her&mdash;half faintness, and half sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe and her sweetheart sat together, waiting the appearance of the
      supper, on a little sofa at the other end of the room. Having certain
      objects to gain, Jervy put his arm round her waist, and looked and spoke
      in his most insinuating manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try and put up with Mother Sowler for an hour or two,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My sweet
      girl, I know she isn&rsquo;t fit company for you! But how can I turn my back on
      an old friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what surprises me,&rdquo; Phoebe answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand such
      a person being a friend of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Always ready with the necessary lie, whenever the occasion called for it,
      Jervy invented a pathetic little story, in two short parts. First part:
      Mrs. Sowler, rich and respected; a widow inhabiting a villa-residence, and
      riding in her carriage. Second part: a villainous lawyer; misplaced
      confidence; reckless investments; death of the villain; ruin of Mrs.
      Sowler. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about her misfortunes when she wakes,&rdquo; Jervy
      concluded, &ldquo;or she&rsquo;ll burst out crying, to a dead certainty. Only tell me,
      dear Phoebe, would <i>you</i> turn your back on a forlorn old creature
      because she has outlived all her other friends, and hasn&rsquo;t a farthing left
      in the world? Poor as I am, I can help her to a supper, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe expressed her admiration of these noble sentiments by an
      inexpensive ebullition of tenderness, which failed to fulfill Jervy&rsquo;s
      private anticipations. He had aimed straight at her purse&mdash;and he had
      only hit her heart! He tried a broad hint next. &ldquo;I wonder whether I shall
      have a shilling or two left to give Mrs. Sowler, when I have paid for the
      supper?&rdquo; He sighed, and pulled out some small change, and looked at it in
      eloquent silence. Phoebe was hit in the right place at last. She handed
      him her purse. &ldquo;What is mine will be yours, when we are married,&rdquo; she
      said; &ldquo;why not now?&rdquo; Jervy expressed his sense of obligation with the
      promptitude of a grateful man; he repeated those precious words, &ldquo;My sweet
      girl!&rdquo; Phoebe laid her head on his shoulder&mdash;and let him kiss her,
      and enjoyed it in silent ecstasy with half-closed eyes. The scoundrel
      waited and watched her, until she was completely under his influence.
      Then, and not till then, he risked the gradual revelation of the purpose
      which had induced him to withdraw from the hall, before the proceedings of
      the evening had reached their end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear what Mrs. Sowler said to me, just before we left the
      lecture?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember that she asked me to tell her Farnaby&rsquo;s address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! And she wanted to know if he had ever gone by the name of Morgan.
      Ridiculous&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that, my dear. She told me, in so many words, that
      Farnaby owed her money. He didn&rsquo;t make his fortune all at once, I suppose.
      How do we know what he might have done in his young days, or how he might
      have humbugged a feeble woman. Wait till our friend there at the fire has
      warmed her old bones with some hot grog&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll find out something
      more about Farnaby&rsquo;s debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dear? What is it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy reflected for a moment, and decided that the time had come to speak
      more plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would only be an act of common
      humanity, on my part, to help Mrs. Sowler to get her money. You see that,
      don&rsquo;t you? Very well. Now, I am no Socialist, as you are aware; quite the
      contrary. At the same time, I am a remarkably just man; and I own I was
      struck by what Mr. Goldenheart said about the uses to which wealthy people
      are put, by the Rules at Tadmor. &lsquo;The man who has got the money is bound,
      by the express law of Christian morality, to use it in assisting the man
      who has got none.&rsquo; Those were his words, as nearly as I can remember them.
      He put it still more strongly afterwards; he said, &lsquo;A man who hoards up a
      large fortune, from a purely selfish motive&mdash;either because he is a
      miser, or because he looks only to the aggrandisement of his own family
      after his death&mdash;is, in either case, an essentially unchristian
      person, who stands in manifest need of enlightenment and control by
      Christian law.&rsquo; And then, if you remember, some of the people murmured;
      and Mr. Goldenheart stopped them by reading a line from the New Testament,
      which said exactly what he had been saying&mdash;only in fewer words. Now,
      my dear girl, Farnaby seems to me to be one of the many people pointed at
      in this young gentleman&rsquo;s lecture. Judging by looks, I should say he was a
      hard man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what he is&mdash;hard as iron! Looks at his servants as if
      they were dirt under his feet; and never speaks a kind word to them from
      one year&rsquo;s end to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I guess again? He&rsquo;s not particularly free-handed with his money&mdash;is
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! He will spend anything on himself and his grandeur; but he never gave
      away a halfpenny in his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy pointed to the fireplace, with a burst of virtuous indignation. &ldquo;And
      there&rsquo;s that poor old soul starving for want of the money he owes her!
      Damn it, I agree with the Socialists; it&rsquo;s a virtue to make that sort of
      man bleed. Look at you and me! We are the very people he ought to help&mdash;we
      might be married at once, if we only knew where to find a little money.
      I&rsquo;ve seen a deal of the world, Phoebe; and my experience tells me there&rsquo;s
      something about that debt of Farnaby&rsquo;s which he doesn&rsquo;t want to have
      known. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we screw a few five-pound notes for ourselves out of
      the rich miser&rsquo;s fears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe was cautious. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the law&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me to keep clear of the law,&rdquo; Jervy answered. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stir in the
      matter till I know for certain that he daren&rsquo;t take the police into his
      confidence. It will be all easy enough when we are once sure of that. You
      have been long enough in the family to find out Farnaby&rsquo;s weak side. Would
      it do, if we got at him, to begin with, through his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe suddenly reddened to the roots of her hair. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about
      his wife!&rdquo; she broke out fiercely; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a day of reckoning to come
      with that lady&mdash;&rdquo; She looked at Jervy and checked herself. He was
      watching her with an eager curiosity, which not even his ready cunning was
      quick enough to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t intrude on your little secrets, darling, for the world!&rdquo; he
      said, in his most persuasive tones. &ldquo;But, if you want advice, you know
      that I am heart and soul at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe looked across the room at Mrs. Sowler, still nodding over the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind now,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a matter for a man to
      advise about&mdash;it&rsquo;s between Mrs. Farnaby and me. Do what you like with
      her husband; I don&rsquo;t care; he&rsquo;s a brute, and I hate him. But there&rsquo;s one
      thing I insist on&mdash;I won&rsquo;t have Miss Regina frightened or annoyed;
      mind that! She&rsquo;s a good creature. There, read the letter she wrote to me
      yesterday, and judge for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy looked at the letter. It was not very long. He resignedly took upon
      himself the burden of reading it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR PHOEBE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be downhearted. I am your friend always, and I will help you to get
      another place. I am sorry to say that it was indeed Mrs. Ormond who found
      us out that day. She had her suspicions, and she watched us, and told my
      aunt. This she owned to me with her own lips. She said, &lsquo;I would do
      anything, my dear, to save you from an ill-assorted marriage.&rsquo; I am very
      wretched about it, because I can never look on her as my friend again. My
      aunt, as you know, is of Mrs. Ormond&rsquo;s way of thinking. You must make
      allowances for her hot temper. Remember, out of your kindness towards me,
      you had been secretly helping forward the very thing which she was most
      anxious to prevent. That made her very angry; but, never fear, she will
      come round in time. If you don&rsquo;t want to spend your little savings, while
      you are waiting for another situation, let me know. A share of my
      pocket-money is always at your service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;REGINA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nice indeed,&rdquo; said Jervy, handing the letter back, and yawning as he
      did it. &ldquo;And convenient, too, if we run short of money. Ah, here&rsquo;s the
      waiter with the supper, at last! Now, Mrs. Sowler, there&rsquo;s a time for
      everything&mdash;it&rsquo;s time to wake up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted the old woman off her chair, and settled her before the table,
      like a child. The sight of the hot food and drink roused her to a tigerish
      activity. She devoured the meat with her eyes as well as her teeth; she
      drank the hot gin-and-water in fierce gulps, and set down the glass with
      audible gasps of relief. &ldquo;Another one,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and I shall begin to
      feel warm again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy, watching her from the opposite side of the table, with Phoebe close
      by him as usual, had his own motives for encouraging her to talk, by the
      easy means of encouraging her to drink. He sent for another glass of the
      hot grog. Phoebe, daintily picking up her oysters with her fork, affected
      to be shocked at Mrs. Sowler&rsquo;s coarse method of eating and drinking. She
      kept her eyes on her plate, and only consented to taste malt liquor under
      modest protest. When Jervy lit a cigar, after finishing his supper, she
      reminded him, in an impressively genteel manner, of the consideration
      which he owed to the presence of an elderly lady. &ldquo;I like it myself,
      dear,&rdquo; she said mincingly; &ldquo;but perhaps Mrs. Sowler objects to the smell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler burst into a hoarse laugh. &ldquo;Do I look as if I was likely to be
      squeamish about smells?&rdquo; she asked, with the savage contempt for her own
      poverty, which was one of the dangerous elements in her character. &ldquo;See
      the place I live in, young woman, and then talk about smells if you like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was indelicate. Phoebe picked a last oyster out of its shell, and
      kept her eyes modestly fixed on her plate. Observing that the second glass
      of gin-and-water was fast becoming empty, Jervy risked the first advances,
      on his way to Mrs. Sowler&rsquo;s confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that debt of Farnaby&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Is it a debt of long standing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler was on her guard. In other words, Mrs. Sowler&rsquo;s head was only
      assailable by hot grog, when hot grog was administered in large
      quantities. She said it was a debt of long standing, and she said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it been standing seven years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler emptied her glass, and looked hard at Jervy across the table.
      &ldquo;My memory isn&rsquo;t good for much, at my time of life.&rdquo; She gave him that
      answer, and she gave him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jervy yielded with his best grace. &ldquo;Try a third glass,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      luck, you know, in odd numbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler met this advance in the spirit in which it was made. She was
      obliging enough to consult her memory, even before the third glass made
      its appearance. &ldquo;Seven years, did you say?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;More than twice
      seven years, Jervy! What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy wasted no time in thinking. He went on with his questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure that the man I pointed out to you, at the lecture, is
      the same man who went by the name of Morgan, and had his letters addressed
      to the public-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure. I&rsquo;d swear to him anywhere&mdash;only by his eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you never yet asked him to pay the debt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I ask him, when I never knew what his name was till you told me
      to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What amount of money does he owe you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether Mrs. Sowler had her mind prophetically fixed on a fourth glass of
      grog, or whether she thought it time to begin asking questions on her own
      account, is not easy to say. Whatever her motive might be, she slyly shook
      her head, and winked at Jervy. &ldquo;The money&rsquo;s my business,&rdquo; she remarked.
      &ldquo;You tell me where he lives&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll make him pay me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy was equal to the occasion. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do anything of the sort,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler laughed defiantly. &ldquo;So you think, my fine fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think at all, old lady&mdash;I&rsquo;m certain. In the first place,
      Farnaby don&rsquo;t owe you the debt by law, after seven years. In the second
      place, just look at yourself in the glass there. Do you think the servants
      will let you in, when you knock at Farnaby&rsquo;s door? You want a clever
      fellow to help you&mdash;or you&rsquo;ll never recover that debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler was accessible to reason (even half-way through her third
      glass of grog), when reason was presented to her in convincing terms. She
      came to the point at once. &ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Jervy answered; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t look to <i>you</i> to pay my
      commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler reflected a little&mdash;and understood him. &ldquo;Say that again,&rdquo;
       she insisted, &ldquo;in the presence of your young woman as witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy touched his young woman&rsquo;s hand under the table, warning her to make
      no objection, and to leave it to him. Having declared for the second time
      that he would not take a farthing from Mrs. Sowler, he went on with his
      inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m acting in your interests, Mother Sowler,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll be the
      loser, if you don&rsquo;t answer my questions patiently, and tell me the truth.
      I want to go back to the debt. What is it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For six weeks&rsquo; keep of a child, at ten shillings a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe looked up from her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose child?&rdquo; Jervy asked, noticing the sudden movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morgan&rsquo;s child&mdash;the same man you said was Farnaby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who the mother was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I did! I should have got the money out of her long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy stole a look at Phoebe. She had turned pale; she was listening, with
      her eyes riveted on Mrs. Sowler&rsquo;s ugly face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago was it?&rdquo; Jervy went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than sixteen years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Farnaby himself give you the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With his own hands, over the garden-paling of a house at Ramsgate. He saw
      me and the child into the train for London. I had ten pounds from him, and
      no more. He promised to see me, and settle everything, in a month&rsquo;s time.
      I have never set eyes on him from that day, till I saw him paying his
      money this evening at the door of the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy stole another look at Phoebe. She was still perfectly unconscious
      that he was observing her. Her attention was completely absorbed by Mrs.
      Sowler&rsquo;s replies. Speculating on the possible result, Jervy abandoned the
      question of the debt, and devoted his next inquiries to the subject of the
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you every farthing of your money, Mother Sowler,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;with interest added to it. How old was the child when Farnaby gave it to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old? Not a week old, I should say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a week old?&rdquo; Jervy repeated, with his eye on Phoebe. &ldquo;Dear, dear me,
      a newborn baby, one may say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s excitement was fast getting beyond control. She leaned across
      the table, in her eagerness to hear more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long was this poor child under your care?&rdquo; Jervy went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell you, at this distance of time? For some months, I should
      say. This I&rsquo;m certain of&mdash;I kept it for six good weeks after the ten
      pounds he gave me were spent. And then&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped, and looked at
      Phoebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you got rid of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler felt for Jervy&rsquo;s foot under the table, and gave it a
      significant kick. &ldquo;I have done nothing to be ashamed of, miss,&rdquo; she said,
      addressing her answer defiantly to Phoebe. &ldquo;Being too poor to keep the
      little dear myself, I placed it under the care of a good lady, who adopted
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe could restrain herself no longer. She burst out with the next
      question, before Jervy could open his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where the lady is now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sowler shortly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where to find the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler slowly stirred up the remains of her grog. &ldquo;I know no more
      than you do. Any more questions, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe&rsquo;s excitement completely blinded her to the evident signs of a
      change in Mrs. Sowler&rsquo;s temper for the worse. She went on headlong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never seen the child since you gave her to the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler set down her glass, just as she was raising it to her lips.
      Jervy paused, thunderstruck, in the act of lighting a second cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Her?&rdquo;</i> Mrs. Sowler repeated slowly, her eyes fixed on Phoebe with a
      lowering expression of suspicion and surprise. &ldquo;Her?&rdquo; She turned to Jervy.
      &ldquo;Did you ask me if the child was a girl or a boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never even thought of it,&rdquo; Jervy replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I happen to say it myself, without being asked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy deliberately abandoned Phoebe to the implacable old wretch, before
      whom she had betrayed herself. It was the only likely way of forcing the
      girl to confess everything. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;you never said it without
      being asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler turned once more to Phoebe. &ldquo;How do you know the child was a
      girl?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe trembled, and said nothing. She sat with her head down, and her
      hands, fast clasped together, resting on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I ask, if you please,&rdquo; Mrs. Sowler proceeded, with a ferocious
      assumption of courtesy, &ldquo;how old you are, miss? You&rsquo;re young enough and
      pretty enough not to mind answering to your age, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Jervy&rsquo;s villainous experience of the world failed to forewarn him of
      what was coming. Phoebe, it is needless to say, instantly fell into the
      trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-four,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;next birthday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the child was put into my hands, sixteen years ago,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Sowler. &ldquo;Take sixteen from twenty-four, and eight remains. I&rsquo;m more
      surprised than ever, miss, at your knowing it to be a girl. It couldn&rsquo;t
      have been your child&mdash;could it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe started to her feet, in a state of fury. &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; she
      cried, appealing to Jervy. &ldquo;How dare you bring me here to be insulted by
      that drunken wretch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler rose, on her side. The old savage snatched up her empty glass&mdash;intending
      to throw it at Phoebe. At the same moment, the ready Jervy caught her by
      the arm, dragged her out of the room, and shut the door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bench on the landing outside. He pushed Mrs. Sowler down on
      the bench with one hand, and took Phoebe&rsquo;s purse out of his pocket with
      the other. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pound,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;towards the recovery of that debt
      of yours. Go home quietly, and meet me at the door of this house tomorrow
      evening, at six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler, opening her lips to protest, suddenly closed them again,
      fascinated by the sight of the gold. She clutched the coin, and became
      friendly and familiar in a moment. &ldquo;Help me downstairs, deary,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;and put me into a cab. I&rsquo;m afraid of the night air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word more, before I put you into a cab,&rdquo; said Jervy. &ldquo;What did you
      really do with the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler grinned hideously, and whispered her reply, in the strictest
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sold her to Moll Davies, for five-and-sixpence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was Moll Davis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cadger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really know nothing now of Moll Davis or the child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I want you to help me if I did?&rdquo; Mrs. Sowler asked contemptuously.
      &ldquo;They may be both dead and buried, for all I know to the contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy put her into the cab, without further delay. &ldquo;Now for the other
      one!&rdquo; he said to himself, as he hurried back to the private room.

      CHAPTER 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some men would have found it no easy task to console Phoebe, under the
      circumstances. Jervy had the immense advantage of not feeling the
      slightest sympathy for her: he was in full command of his large resources
      of fluent assurance and ready flattery. In less than five minutes,
      Phoebe&rsquo;s tears were dried, and her lover had his arm round her waist
      again, in the character of a cherished and forgiven man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my angel!&rdquo; he said (Phoebe sighed tenderly; he had never called her
      his angel before), &ldquo;tell me all about it in confidence. Only let me know
      the facts, and I shall see my way to protecting you against any annoyance
      from Mrs. Sowler in the future. You have made a very extraordinary
      discovery. Come closer to me, my dear girl. Did it happen in Farnaby&rsquo;s
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard it in the kitchen,&rdquo; said Phoebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jervy started. &ldquo;Did any one else hear it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. They were all in the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, looking at the Indian
      curiosities which her son in Canada had sent to her. I had left my bird on
      the dresser&mdash;and I ran into the kitchen to put the cage in a safe
      place, being afraid of the cat. One of the swinging windows in the
      skylight was open; and I heard voices in the back room above, which is
      Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose voices did you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s voice, and Mr. Goldenheart&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Farnaby?&rdquo; Jervy repeated, in surprise. &ldquo;Are you sure it was <i>Mrs.?&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am! Do you think I don&rsquo;t know that horrid woman&rsquo;s voice? She
      was saying a most extraordinary thing when I first heard her&mdash;she was
      asking if there was anything wrong in showing her naked foot. And a man
      answered, and the voice was Mr. Goldenheart&rsquo;s. You would have felt curious
      to hear more, if you had been in my place, wouldn&rsquo;t you? I opened the
      second window in the kitchen, so as to make sure of not missing anything.
      And what do you think I heard her say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Mrs. Farnaby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I heard her say, &lsquo;Look at my right foot&mdash;you see there&rsquo;s
      nothing the matter with it.&rsquo; And then, after a while, she said, &lsquo;Look at
      my left foot&mdash;look between the third toe and the fourth.&rsquo; Did you
      ever hear of such a audacious thing for a married woman to say to a young
      man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on! go on! What did <i>he</i> say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing; I suppose he was looking at her foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her left foot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Her left foot was nothing to be proud of, I can tell you! By her own
      account, she has some horrid deformity in it, between the third toe and
      the fourth. No; I didn&rsquo;t hear her say what the deformity was. I only heard
      her call it so&mdash;and she said her &lsquo;poor darling&rsquo; was born with the
      same fault, and that was her defence against being imposed upon by rogues&mdash;I
      remember the very words&mdash;&lsquo;in the past days when I employed people to
      find her.&rsquo; Yes! she said <i>&lsquo;her.&lsquo;</i> I heard it plainly. And she talked
      afterwards of her &lsquo;poor lost daughter&rsquo;, who might be still living
      somewhere, and wondering who her mother was. Naturally enough, when I
      heard that hateful old drunkard talking about a child given to her by Mr.
      Farnaby, I put two and two together. Dear me, how strangely you look!
      What&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only very much interested&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. But there&rsquo;s one thing I
      don&rsquo;t understand. What had Mr. Goldenheart to do with all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I tell you now. Mrs. Farnaby is not only a heartless wretch,
      who turns a poor girl out of her situation, and refuses to give her a
      character&mdash;she&rsquo;s a fool besides. That precious exhibition of her
      nasty foot was to inform Mr. Goldenheart of something she wanted him to
      know. If he happened to meet with a girl, in his walks or his travels, and
      if he found that she had the same deformity in the same foot, then he
      might know for certain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! I understand. But why Mr. Goldenheart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she had a dream that Mr. Goldenheart had found the lost girl, and
      because she thought there was one chance in a hundred that her dream might
      come true! Did you ever hear of such a fool before? From what I could make
      out, I believe she actually cried about it. And that same woman turns me
      into the street to be ruined, for all she knows or cares. Mind this! I
      would have kept her secret&mdash;it was no business of mine, after all&mdash;if
      she had behaved decently to me. As it is, I mean to be even with her; and
      what I heard down in the kitchen is more than enough to help me to it.
      I&rsquo;ll expose her somehow&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite know how; but that will come
      with time. You will keep the secret, dear, I&rsquo;m sure. We are soon to have
      all our secrets in common, when we are man and wife, ain&rsquo;t we? Why, you&rsquo;re
      not listening to me! What <i>is</i> the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy suddenly looked up. His soft insinuating manner had vanished; he
      spoke roughly and impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know something. Has Farnaby&rsquo;s wife got money of her own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe&rsquo;s mind was still disturbed by the change in her lover. &ldquo;You speak
      as if you were angry with me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jervy recovered his insinuating tones, with some difficulty. &ldquo;My dear
      girl, I love you! How can I be angry with you? You&rsquo;ve set me thinking&mdash;and
      it bothers me a little, that&rsquo;s all. Do you happen to know if Mrs. Farnaby
      has got money of her own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe answered this time. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Miss Regina say that Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s
      father was a rich man,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ronald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know when he died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy fell into thought again, biting his nails in great perplexity. After
      a moment or two, an idea came to him. &ldquo;The tombstone will tell me!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, speaking to himself. He turned to Phoebe, before she could
      express her surprise, and asked if she knew where Mr. Ronald was buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Phoebe, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that. In Highgate cemetery. But why do you
      want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy looked at his watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you
      safe home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on your bonnet, and wait till we are out in the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy paid the bill, with all needful remembrance of the waiter. He was
      generous, he was polite; but he was apparently in no hurry to favour
      Phoebe with the explanation that he had promised. They had left the tavern
      for some minutes&mdash;and he was still rude enough to remain absorbed in
      his own reflections. Phoebe&rsquo;s patience gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you everything,&rdquo; she said reproachfully; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call it
      fair dealing to keep me in the dark after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He roused himself directly. &ldquo;My dear girl, you entirely mistake me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply was as ready as usual; but it was spoken rather absently. Only
      that moment, he had decided on informing Phoebe (to some extent, at least)
      of the purpose which he was then meditating. He would infinitely have
      preferred using Mrs. Sowler as his sole accomplice. But he knew the girl
      too well to run that risk. If he refused to satisfy her curiosity, she
      would be deterred by no scruples of delicacy from privately watching him;
      and she might say something (either by word of month or by writing) to the
      kind young mistress who was in correspondence with her, which might lead
      to disastrous results. It was of the last importance to him, so far to
      associate Phoebe with his projected enterprise, as to give her an interest
      of her own in keeping his secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the least wish,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;to conceal any thing from you.
      So far as I can see my way at present, you shall see it too.&rdquo; Reserving in
      this dexterous manner the freedom of lying, whenever he found it necessary
      to depart from the truth, he smiled encouragingly, and waited to be
      questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe repeated the inquiry she had made at the tavern. &ldquo;Why do you want
      to know where Mr. Ronald is buried?&rdquo; she asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ronald&rsquo;s tombstone, my dear, will tell me the date of Mr. Ronald&rsquo;s
      death,&rdquo; Jervy rejoined. &ldquo;When I have got the date, I shall go to a place
      near St. Paul&rsquo;s, called Doctors&rsquo; Commons; I shall pay a shilling fee, and
      I shall have the privilege of looking at Mr. Ronald&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what good will that do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very properly put, Phoebe! Even shillings are not to be wasted, in our
      position. But my shilling will buy two sixpennyworths of information. I
      shall find out what sum of money Mr. Ronald has left to his daughter; and
      I shall know for certain whether Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s husband has any power over
      it, or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Phoebe, not much interested so far&mdash;&ldquo;and what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy looked about him. They were in a crowded thoroughfare at the time.
      He preserved a discreet silence, until they had arrived at the first
      turning which led down a quiet street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have to tell you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;must not be accidentally heard by
      anybody. Here, my dear, we are all but out of the world&mdash;and here I
      can speak to you safely. I promise you two good things. You shall bring
      Mrs. Farnaby to that day of reckoning; and we will find money enough to
      marry on comfortably as soon as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe&rsquo;s languid interest in the subject began to revive: she insisted on
      having a clearer explanation than this. &ldquo;Do you mean to get the money out
      of Mr. Farnaby?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have nothing to do with Mr. Farnaby&mdash;unless I find that his
      wife&rsquo;s money is not at her own disposal. What you heard in the kitchen has
      altered all my plans. Wait a minute&mdash;and you will see what I am
      driving at. How much do you think Mrs. Farnaby would give me, if I found
      that lost daughter of hers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe suddenly stood still, and looked at the sordid scoundrel who was
      tempting her in blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nobody knows where the daughter is,&rdquo; she objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I know that the daughter has a deformity in her left foot,&rdquo; Jervy
      replied; &ldquo;and you and I know exactly in what part of the foot it is.
      There&rsquo;s not only money to be made out of that knowledge&mdash;but money
      made easily, without the slightest risk. Suppose I managed the matter by
      correspondence, without appearing in it personally? Don&rsquo;t you think Mrs.
      Farnaby would open her purse beforehand, if I mentioned the exact position
      of that little deformity, as a proof that I was to be depended on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe was unable, or unwilling, to draw the obvious conclusion, even now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, what would you do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when Mrs. Farnaby insisted on seeing
      her daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the girl&rsquo;s tone&mdash;half fearful, half suspicious&mdash;which
      warned Jervy that he was treading on dangerous ground. He knew perfectly
      well what he proposed to do, in the case that had been so plainly put him.
      It was the simplest thing in the world. He had only to make an appointment
      with Mrs. Farnaby for a meeting on a future day, and to take to flight in
      the interval; leaving a polite note behind him to say that it was all a
      mistake, and that he regretted being too poor to return the money. Having
      thus far acknowledged the design he had in view, could he still venture on
      answering his companion without reserve? Phoebe was vain, Phoebe was
      vindictive; and, more promising still, Phoebe was a fool. But she was not
      yet capable of consenting to an act of the vilest infamy, in cold blood.
      Jervy looked at her&mdash;and saw that the foreseen necessity for lying
      had come at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the difficulty,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just where I don&rsquo;t see my
      way plainly yet. Can you advise me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe started, and drew back from him. <i>&ldquo;I</i> advise you!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;It frightens me to think of it. If you make her believe she is
      going to see her daughter, and if she finds out that you have robbed and
      deceived her, I can tell you this&mdash;with her furious temper&mdash;you
      would drive her mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy&rsquo;s reply was a model of well-acted indignation. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of
      anything so horrible,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If you believe me capable of such
      cruelty as that, go to Mrs. Farnaby, and warn her at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad to speak to me in that way!&rdquo; Phoebe rejoined, with the frank
      impetuosity of an offended woman. &ldquo;You know I would die, rather than get
      you into trouble. Beg my pardon directly&mdash;or I won&rsquo;t walk another
      step with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy made the necessary apologies, with all possible humility. He had
      gained his end&mdash;he could now postpone any further discussion of the
      subject, without arousing Phoebe&rsquo;s distrust. &ldquo;Let us say no more about it,
      for the present,&rdquo; he suggested; &ldquo;we will think it over, and talk of
      pleasanter things in the mean time. Kiss me, my dear girl; there&rsquo;s nobody
      looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he made peace with his sweetheart, and secured to himself, at the same
      time, the full liberty of future action of which he stood in need. If
      Phoebe asked any more questions, the necessary answer was obvious to the
      meanest capacity. He had merely to say, &ldquo;The matter is beset with
      difficulties which I didn&rsquo;t see at first&mdash;I have given it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their nearest way back to Phoebe&rsquo;s lodgings took them through the street
      which led to the Hampden Institution. Passing along the opposite side of
      the road, they saw the private door opened. Two men stepped out. A third
      man, inside, called after one of them. &ldquo;Mr. Goldenheart! you have left the
      statement of receipts in the waiting-room.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Amelius
      answered; &ldquo;the night&rsquo;s receipts are so small that I would rather not be
      reminded of them again.&rdquo; &ldquo;In my country,&rdquo; a third voice remarked, &ldquo;if he
      had lectured as he has lectured to-night, I reckon I&rsquo;d have given him
      three hundred dollars, gold (sixty pounds, English currency), and have
      made my own profit by the transaction. The British nation has lost its
      taste, sir, for intellectual recreation. I wish you good evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy hurried Phoebe out of the way, just as the two gentlemen were
      crossing the street. He had not forgotten events at Tadmor&mdash;and he
      was by no means eager to renew his former acquaintance with Amelius.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rufus and his young friend walked together silently as far as a large
      square. Here they stopped, having reached the point at which it was
      necessary to take different directions on their way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a word of advice, my son, for your private ear,&rdquo; said the New
      Englander. &ldquo;The barometer behind your waistcoat points to a downhearted
      state of the moral atmosphere. Come along to home with me&mdash;you want a
      whisky cocktail badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, my dear fellow,&rdquo; Amelius answered a little sadly. &ldquo;I own
      I&rsquo;m downhearted, as you say. You see, I expected this lecture to be a new
      opening for me. Personally, as you know, I don&rsquo;t care two straws about
      money. But my marriage depends on my adding to my income; and the first
      attempt I&rsquo;ve made to do it has ended in a total failure. I&rsquo;m all abroad
      again, when I look to the future&mdash;and I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m fool enough to
      let it weigh on my spirits. No, the cocktail isn&rsquo;t the right remedy for
      me. I don&rsquo;t get the exercise and fresh air, here, that I used to get at
      Tadmor. My head burns after all that talking to-night. A good long walk
      will put me right, and nothing else will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus at once offered to accompany him. Amelius shook his head. &ldquo;Did you
      ever walk a mile in your life, when you could ride?&rdquo; he asked
      good-humouredly. &ldquo;I mean to be on my legs for four or five hours; I should
      only have to send you home in a cab. Thank you, old fellow, for the
      brotherly interest you take in me. I&rsquo;ll breakfast with you to-morrow, at
      your hotel. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some curious prevision of evil seemed to trouble the mind of the good New
      Englander. He held Amelius fast by the hand: he said, very earnestly, &ldquo;It
      goes against the grit with me to see you wandering off by yourself at this
      time of night&mdash;it does, I tell you! Do me a favour for once, my
      bright boy&mdash;go right away to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius laughed, and released his hand. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t sleep, if I did go to
      bed. Breakfast to-morrow, at ten o&rsquo;clock. Goodnight, again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started on his walk, at a pace which set pursuit on the part of Rufus
      at defiance. The American stood watching him, until he was lost to sight
      in the darkness. &ldquo;What a grip that young fellow has got on me, in no more
      than a few months!&rdquo; Rufus thought, as he slowly turned away in the
      direction of his hotel. &ldquo;Lord send the poor boy may keep clear of mischief
      this night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Amelius walked on swiftly, straight before him, careless in
      what direction he turned his steps, so long as he felt the cool air and
      kept moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts were not at first occupied with the doubtful question of his
      marriage; the lecture was still the uppermost subject in his mind. He had
      reserved for the conclusion of his address the justification of his view
      of the future, afforded by the widespread and frightful poverty among the
      millions of the population of London alone. On this melancholy theme he
      had spoken with the eloquence of true feeling, and had produced a strong
      impression, even on those members of the audience who were most resolutely
      opposed to the opinions which he advocated. Without any undue exercise of
      self-esteem, he could look back on the close of his lecture with the
      conviction that he had really done justice to himself and to his cause.
      The retrospect of the public discussion that had followed failed to give
      him the same pleasure. His warm temper, his vehemently sincere belief in
      the truth of his own convictions, placed him at a serious disadvantage
      towards the more self-restrained speakers (all older than himself) who
      rose, one after another, to combat his views. More than once he had lost
      his temper, and had been obliged to make his apologies. More than once he
      had been indebted to the ready help of Rufus, who had taken part in the
      battle of words, with the generous purpose of covering his retreat. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
       he thought to himself, with bitter humility, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fit for public
      discussions. If they put me into Parliament tomorrow, I should only get
      called to order and do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reached the bank of the Thames, at the eastward end of the Strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking straight on, as absently as ever, he crossed Waterloo Bridge, and
      followed the broad street that lay before him on the other side. He was
      thinking of the future again: Regina was in his mind now. The one prospect
      that he could see of a tranquil and happy life&mdash;with duties as well
      as pleasures; duties that might rouse him to find the vocation for which
      he was fit&mdash;was the prospect of his marriage. What was the obstacle
      that stood in his way? The vile obstacle of money; the contemptible spirit
      of ostentation which forbade him to live humbly on his own sufficient
      little income, and insisted that he should purchase domestic happiness at
      the price of the tawdry splendour of a rich tradesman and his friends. And
      Regina, who was free to follow her own better impulses&mdash;Regina, whose
      heart acknowledged him as its master&mdash;bowed before the golden image
      which was the tutelary deity of her uncle&rsquo;s household, and said
      resignedly, Love must wait!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still walking blindly on, he was roused on a sudden to a sense of passing
      events. Crossing a side-street at the moment, a man caught him roughly by
      the arm, and saved him from being run over. The man had a broom in his
      hand; he was a crossing-sweeper. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve earned my penny, sir!&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius gave him half-a-crown. The man shouldered his broom, and tossed up
      the money, in a transport of delight. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something to go home with!&rdquo;
       he cried, as he caught the half-crown again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got a family at home?&rdquo; Amelius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one, sir,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;The others are all dead. She&rsquo;s as good a
      girl and as pretty a girl as ever put on a petticoat&mdash;though I say it
      that shouldn&rsquo;t. Thank you kindly, sir. Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked after the poor fellow, happy at least for that night! &ldquo;If I
      had only been lucky enough to fall in love with the crossing-sweeper&rsquo;s
      daughter,&rdquo; he thought bitterly, <i>&ldquo;she</i> would have married me when I
      asked her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked along the street. It curved away in the distance, with no
      visible limit to it. Arrived at the next side-street on his left, Amelius
      turned down it, weary of walking longer in the same direction. Whither it
      might lead him he neither knew nor cared. In his present humour it was a
      pleasurable sensation to feel himself lost in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The short street suddenly widened; a blaze of flaring gaslight dazzled his
      eyes; he heard all round him the shouting of innumerable voices. For the
      first time since he had been in London, he found himself in one of the
      street-markets of the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On either side of the road, the barrows of the costermongers&mdash;the
      wandering tradesmen of the highway&mdash;were drawn up in rows; and every
      man was advertising his wares, by means of the cheap publicity of his own
      voice. Fish and vegetables; pottery and writing-paper; looking-glasses,
      saucepans, and coloured prints&mdash;all appealed together to the scantily
      filled purses of the crowds who thronged the pavement. One lusty vagabond
      stood up in a rickety donkey-cart, knee-deep in apples, selling a great
      wooden measure full for a penny, and yelling louder than all the rest.
      &ldquo;Never was such apples sold in the public streets before! Sweet as
      flowers, and sound as a bell. Who says the poor ain&rsquo;t looked after,&rdquo; cried
      the fellow, with ferocious irony, &ldquo;when they can have such apple-sauce as
      this to their loin of pork? Here&rsquo;s nobby apples; here&rsquo;s a penn&rsquo;orth for
      your money. Sold again! Hullo, you! you look hungry. Catch! there&rsquo;s an
      apple for nothing, just to taste. Be in time, be in time before they&rsquo;re
      all sold!&rdquo; Amelius moved forward a few steps, and was half deafened by
      rival butchers, shouting, &ldquo;Buy, buy, buy!&rdquo; to audiences of ragged women,
      who fingered the meat doubtfully, with longing eyes. A little farther&mdash;and
      there was a blind man selling staylaces, and singing a Psalm; and, beyond
      him again, a broken-down soldier playing &ldquo;God save the Queen&rdquo; on a tin
      flageolet. The one silent person in this sordid carnival was a Lascar
      beggar, with a printed placard round his neck, addressed to &ldquo;The
      Charitable Public.&rdquo; He held a tallow candle to illuminate the copious
      narrative of his misfortunes; and the one reader he obtained was a fat
      man, who scratched his head, and remarked to Amelius that he didn&rsquo;t like
      foreigners. Starving boys and girls lurked among the costermongers&rsquo; 
      barrows, and begged piteously on pretence of selling cigar-lights and
      comic songs. Furious women stood at the doors of public-houses, and railed
      on their drunken husbands for spending the house-money in gin. A thicker
      crowd, towards the middle of the street, poured in and out at the door of
      a cookshop. Here the people presented a less terrible spectacle&mdash;they
      were even touching to see. These were the patient poor, who bought hot
      morsels of sheep&rsquo;s heart and liver at a penny an ounce, with lamentable
      little mouthfuls of peas-pudding, greens, and potatoes at a halfpenny
      each. Pale children in corners supped on penny basins of soup, and looked
      with hungry admiration at their enviable neighbours who could afford to
      buy stewed eels for twopence. Everywhere there was the same noble
      resignation to their hard fate, in old and young alike. No impatience, no
      complaints. In this wretched place, the language of true gratitude was
      still to be heard, thanking the good-natured cook for a little spoonful of
      gravy thrown in for nothing&mdash;and here, humble mercy that had its one
      superfluous halfpenny to spare gave that halfpenny to utter destitution,
      and gave it with right good-will. Amelius spent all his shillings and
      sixpences, in doubling and trebling the poor little pennyworths of food&mdash;and
      left the place with tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was near the end of the street by this time. The sight of the misery
      about him, and the sense of his own utter inability to remedy it, weighed
      heavily on his spirits. He thought of the peaceful and prosperous life at
      Tadmor. Were his happy brethren of the Community and these miserable
      people about him creatures of the same all-merciful God? The terrible
      doubts which come to all thinking men&mdash;the doubts which are not to be
      stifled by crying &ldquo;Oh, fie!&rdquo; in a pulpit&mdash;rose darkly in his mind. He
      quickened his pace. &ldquo;Let me let out of it,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;let me
      get out of it!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      Amelius found it no easy matter to pass quickly through the people
      loitering and gossiping about him. There was greater freedom for a rapid
      walker in the road. He was on the point of stepping off the pavement, when
      a voice behind him&mdash;a sweet soft voice, though it spoke very faintly&mdash;said,
      &ldquo;Are you good-natured, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and found himself face to face with one of the saddest
      sisterhood on earth&mdash;the sisterhood of the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart ached as he looked at her, she was so poor and so young. The
      lost creature had, to all appearance, barely passed the boundary between
      childhood and girlhood&mdash;she could hardly be more than fifteen or
      sixteen years old. Her eyes, of the purest and loveliest blue, rested on
      Amelius with a vacantly patient look, like the eyes of a suffering child.
      The soft oval outline of her face would have been perfect if the cheeks
      had been filled out; they were wasted and hollow, and sadly pale. Her
      delicate lips had none of the rosy colour of youth; and her finely
      modelled chin was disfigured by a piece of plaster covering some injury.
      She was little and thin; her worn and scanty clothing showed her frail
      youthful figure still waiting for its perfection of growth. Her pretty
      little bare hands were reddened by the raw night air. She trembled as
      Amelius looked at her in silence, with compassionate wonder. But for the
      words in which she had accosted him, it would have been impossible to
      associate her with the lamentable life that she led. The appearance of the
      girl was artlessly virginal and innocent; she looked as if she had passed
      through the contamination of the streets without being touched by it,
      without fearing it, or feeling it, or understanding it. Robed in pure
      white, with her gentle blue eyes raised to heaven, a painter might have
      shown her on his canvas as a saint or an angel; and the critical world
      would have said, Here is the true ideal&mdash;Raphael himself might have
      painted this!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look very pale,&rdquo; said Amelius. &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir&mdash;only hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes half closed; she reeled from sheer weakness as she said the
      words. Amelius held her up, and looked round him. They were close to a
      stall at which coffee and slices of bread-and-butter were sold. He ordered
      some coffee to be poured out, and offered her the food. She thanked him
      and tried to eat. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, sir,&rdquo; she said faintly. The bread
      dropped from her hand; her weary head sank on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two young women&mdash;older members of the sad sisterhood&mdash;were
      passing at the moment. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s too far gone, sir, to eat,&rdquo; said one of
      them. &ldquo;I know what would do her good, if you don&rsquo;t mind going into a
      public-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; said Amelius. &ldquo;Be quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the women led the way. The other helped Amelius to support the
      girl. They entered the crowded public-house. In less than a minute, the
      first woman had forced her way through the drunken customers at the bar,
      and had returned with a glass of port-wine and cloves. The girl revived as
      the stimulant passed her lips. She opened her innocent blue eyes again, in
      vague surprise. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t die this time,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A corner of the place was not occupied; a small empty cask stood there.
      Amelius made the poor creature sit down and rest a little. He had only
      gold in his purse; and, when the woman had paid for the wine, he offered
      her some of the change. She declined to take it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a shilling or
      two, sir,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and I can take care of myself. Give it to Simple
      Sally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll save her a beating, sir, for one night at least,&rdquo; said the other
      woman. &ldquo;We call her Simple Sally, because she&rsquo;s a little soft, poor soul&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t
      grown up, you know, in her mind, since she was a child. Give her some of
      your change, sir, and you&rsquo;ll be doing a kind thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that is most unselfish, all that is most divinely compassionate and
      self-sacrificing in a woman&rsquo;s nature, was as beautiful and as undefiled as
      ever in these women&mdash;the outcasts of the hard highway!
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius turned to the girl. Her head had sunk on her bosom; she was half
      asleep. She looked up as he approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have been beaten to-night,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;if you had not met with
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father always beats me, sir,&rdquo; said Simple Sally, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t bring money
      home. He threw a knife at me last night. It didn&rsquo;t hurt much&mdash;it only
      cut me here,&rdquo; said the girl, pointing to the plaster on her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the women touched Amelius on the shoulder, and whispered to him.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no more her father, sir, than I am. She&rsquo;s a helpless creature&mdash;and
      he takes advantage of her. If I only had a place to take her to, he should
      never set eyes on her again. Show the gentleman your bosom, Sally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her poor threadbare little shawl. Over the lovely girlish
      breast, still only growing to the rounded beauty of womanhood, there was a
      hideous blue-black bruise. Simple Sally smiled, and said, &ldquo;That <i>did</i>
      hurt me, sir. I&rsquo;d rather have the knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the nearest drinkers at the bar looked round and laughed. Amelius
      tenderly drew the shawl over the girl&rsquo;s cold bosom. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, let
      us get away from this place!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of the cool night air completed Simple Sally&rsquo;s recovery. She
      was able to eat now. Amelius proposed retracing his steps to the
      provision-shop, and giving her the best food that the place afforded. She
      preferred the bread-and-butter at the coffee-stall. Those thick slices,
      piled up on the plate, tempted her as a luxury. On trying the luxury, one
      slice satisfied her. &ldquo;I thought I was hungry enough to eat the whole
      plateful,&rdquo; said the girl, turning away from the stall, in the vacantly
      submissive manner which it saddened Amelius to see. He bought more of the
      bread-and-butter, on the chance that her appetite might revive. While he
      was wrapping it in a morsel of paper, one of her elder companions touched
      him and whispered, &ldquo;There he is, sir!&rdquo; Amelius looked at her. &ldquo;The brute
      who calls himself her father,&rdquo; the woman explained impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius turned, and saw Simple Sally with her arm in the grasp of a
      half-drunken ruffian; one of the swarming wild beasts of Low London,
      dirtied down from head to foot to the colour of the street mud&mdash;the
      living danger and disgrace of English civilization. As Amelius eyed him,
      he drew the girl away a step or two. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a gentleman this time,&rdquo;
       he said to her; &ldquo;I shall expect gold to-night, or else&mdash;!&rdquo; He
      finished the sentence by lifting his monstrous fist, and shaking it in her
      face. Cautiously as he had lowered his tones in speaking, the words had
      reached the keenly sensitive ears of Amelius. Urged by his hot temper, he
      sprang forward. In another moment, he would have knocked the brute down&mdash;but
      for the timely interference of the arm of the law, clad in a policeman&rsquo;s
      great-coat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get yourself into trouble, sir,&rdquo; said the man
      good-humouredly. &ldquo;Now, you Hell-fire (that&rsquo;s the nice name they know him
      by, sir, in these parts), be off with you!&rdquo; The wild beast on two legs
      cowered at the voice of authority, like the wild beast on four: he was
      lost to sight, at the dark end of the street, in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him threaten her with his fist,&rdquo; said Amelius, his eyes still
      aflame with indignation. &ldquo;He has bruised her frightfully on the breast. Is
      there no protection for the poor creature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; the policeman answered, &ldquo;you can summon him if you like. I
      dare say he&rsquo;d get a month&rsquo;s hard labour. But, don&rsquo;t you see, it would be
      all the worse for her when he came out of prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman&rsquo;s view of the girl&rsquo;s position was beyond dispute. Amelius
      turned to her gently; she was shivering with cold or terror, perhaps with
      both. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that man really your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless you, sir!&rdquo; interposed the policeman, astonished at the
      gentleman&rsquo;s simplicity, &ldquo;Simple Sally hasn&rsquo;t got father or mother&mdash;have
      you, my girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paid no heed to the policeman. The sorrow and sympathy, plainly
      visible in Amelius, filled her with a childish interest and surprise. She
      dimly understood that it was sorrow and sympathy for <i>her.</i> The bare
      idea of distressing this new friend, so unimaginably kind and considerate,
      seemed to frighten her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret about <i>me,</i> sir,&rdquo; she said
      timidly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind having no father nor mother; I don&rsquo;t mind being
      beaten.&rdquo; She appealed to the nearest of her two women-friends. &ldquo;We get
      used to everything, don&rsquo;t we, Jenny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius could bear no more. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to break one&rsquo;s heart to hear you,
      and see you!&rdquo; he burst out&mdash;and suddenly turned his head aside. His
      generous nature was touched to the quick; he could only control himself by
      an effort of resolution that shook him, body and soul. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t
      let that unfortunate creature go back to be beaten and starved!&rdquo; he said,
      passionately addressing himself to the policeman. &ldquo;Oh, look at her! How
      helpless, and how young!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman stared. These were strange words to him. But all true
      emotion carries with it, among all true people, its own title to respect.
      He spoke to Amelius with marked respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard case, sir, no doubt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s a quiet,
      well-disposed creature&mdash;and the other two there are the same. They&rsquo;re
      of the sort that keep to themselves, and don&rsquo;t drink. They all of them do
      well enough, as long as they don&rsquo;t let the liquor overcome them. Half the
      time it&rsquo;s the men&rsquo;s fault when they do drink. Perhaps the workhouse might
      take her in for the night. What&rsquo;s this you&rsquo;ve got girl, in your hand?
      Money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius hastened to say that he had given her the money. &ldquo;The workhouse!&rdquo;
       he repeated. &ldquo;The very sound of it is horrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your mind easy, sir,&rdquo; said the policeman; &ldquo;they won&rsquo;t take her in at
      the workhouse, with money in her hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In sheer despair, Amelius asked helplessly if there was no hotel near. The
      policeman pointed to Simple Sally&rsquo;s threadbare and scanty clothes, and
      left them to answer the question for themselves. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place they
      call a coffee-house,&rdquo; he said, with the air of a man who thought he had
      better provoke as little further inquiry on that subject as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too completely pre-occupied, or too innocent in the ways of London, to
      understand the man, Amelius decided on trying the coffee-house. A
      suspicious old woman met them at the door, and spied the policeman in the
      background. Without waiting for any inquiries, she said, &ldquo;All full for
      to-night,&rdquo;&mdash;and shut the door in their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no other place?&rdquo; said Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lodging-house,&rdquo; the policeman answered, more doubtfully than
      ever. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late, sir; and I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll find &lsquo;em packed like
      herrings in a barrel. Come, and see for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way into a wretchedly lighted by-street, and knocked with his
      foot on a trap-door in the pavement. The door was pushed open from below,
      by a sturdy boy with a dirty night-cap on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any of &lsquo;em wanted to-night, sir?&rdquo; asked the sturdy boy, the moment he saw
      the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; said Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sprinkling of thieves among them, sir,&rdquo; the policeman
      explained. &ldquo;Stand out of the way, Jacob, and let the gentleman look in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced his lantern, and directed the light downwards, as he spoke.
      Amelius looked in. The policeman&rsquo;s figure of speech, likening the lodgers
      to &ldquo;herrings in a barrel,&rdquo; accurately described the scene. On the floor of
      a kitchen, men, women, and children lay all huddled together in closely
      packed rows. Ghastly faces rose terrified out of the seething obscurity,
      when the light of the lantern fell on them. The stench drove Amelius back,
      sickened and shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the sore place on your head, Jacob?&rdquo; the policeman inquired. &ldquo;This
      is a civil boy,&rdquo; he explained to Amelius, &ldquo;and I like to encourage him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting better, sir, as fast as I can,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Jacob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, sir.&rdquo; The trap-door fell&mdash;and the lodging-house
      disappeared like the vision of a frightful dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of silence among the little group on the pavement. It
      was not easy to solve the question of what to do next. &ldquo;There seems to be
      some difficulty,&rdquo; the policeman remarked, &ldquo;about housing this girl for the
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we take her along with us?&rdquo; one of the women suggested.
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t mind sleeping three in a bed, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo; the other woman remonstrated. &ldquo;When he finds
      she don&rsquo;t come home, our place will be the first place he looks for her
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius settled the difficulty, in his own headlong way, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care
      of her for the night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sally, will you trust yourself with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand in his, with the air of a child who was ready to go home.
      Her wan face brightened for the first time. &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go anywhere along with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman smiled. The two women looked thunderstruck. Before they had
      recovered themselves, Amelius forced them to take some money from him, and
      cordially shook hands with them. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re good creatures,&rdquo; he said, in his
      eager, hearty way; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sincerely sorry for you. Now, Mr. Policeman, show
      me where to find a cab&mdash;and take that for the trouble I am giving
      you. You&rsquo;re a humane man, and a credit to the force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes more, Amelius was on the way to his lodgings, with Simple
      Sally by his side. The act of reckless imprudence which he was committing
      was nothing but an act of Christian duty, to his mind. Not the slightest
      misgiving troubled him. &ldquo;I shall provide for her in some way!&rdquo; he thought
      to himself cheerfully. He looked at her. The weary outcast was asleep
      already in her corner of the cab. From time to time she still shivered,
      even in her sleep. Amelius took off his great-coat, and covered her with
      it. How some of his friends at the club would have laughed, if they had
      seen him at that moment!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obliged to wake her when the cab stopped. His key admitted them to
      the house. He lit his candle in the hall, and led her up the stairs.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon be asleep again, Sally,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round the little sitting-room with drowsy admiration. &ldquo;What a
      pretty place to live in!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hungry again?&rdquo; Amelius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and took off her shabby bonnet; her pretty light-brown
      hair fell about her face and her shoulders. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m too tired, sir,
      to be hungry. Might I take the sofa-pillow, and lay down on the
      hearth-rug?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius opened the door of his bedroom. &ldquo;You are to pass the night more
      comfortably than that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;There is a bed for you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She followed him in, and looked round the bedroom, with renewed admiration
      of everything that she saw. At the sight of the hairbrushes and the comb,
      she clapped her hands in ecstasy. &ldquo;Oh, how different from mine!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;Is the comb tortoise-shell, sir, like one sees in the
      shop-windows?&rdquo; The bath and the towels attracted her next; she stood,
      looking at them with longing eyes, completely forgetful of the wonderful
      comb. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often peeped into the ironmongers&rsquo; shops,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
      thought I should be the happiest girl in the world, if I had such a bath
      as that. A little pitcher is all I have got of my own, and they swear at
      me when I want it filled more than once. In all my life, I have never had
      as much water as I should like.&rdquo; She paused, and thought for a moment. The
      forlorn, vacant look appeared again, and dimmed the beauty of her blue
      eyes. &ldquo;It will be hard to go back, after seeing all these pretty things,&rdquo;
       she said to herself&mdash;and sighed, with that inborn submission to her
      fate so melancholy to see in a creature so young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall never go back again to that dreadful life,&rdquo; Amelius interposed.
      &ldquo;Never speak of it, never think of it any more. Oh, don&rsquo;t look at me like
      that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was listening with an expression of pain, and with both her hands
      lifted to her head. There was something so wonderful in the idea which he
      had suggested to her, that her mind was not able to take it all in at
      once. &ldquo;You make my head giddy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m such a poor stupid girl&mdash;I
      feel out of myself, like, when a gentleman like you sets me thinking of
      new things. Would you mind saying it again, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it to-morrow morning,&rdquo; Amelius rejoined kindly. &ldquo;You are tired,
      Sally&mdash;go to rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She roused herself, and looked at the bed. &ldquo;Is that your bed, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your bed to-night,&rdquo; said Amelius. &ldquo;I shall sleep on the sofa, in the
      next room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes rested on him, for a moment, in speechless surprise; she looked
      back again at the bed. &ldquo;Are you going to leave me by myself?&rdquo; she asked
      wonderingly. Not the faintest suggestion of immodesty&mdash;nothing that
      the most profligate man living could have interpreted impurely&mdash;showed
      itself in her look or manner, as she said those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius thought of what one of her women-friends had told him. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t
      grown up, you know, in her mind, since she was a child.&rdquo; There were other
      senses in the poor victim that were still undeveloped, besides the mental
      sense. He was at a loss how to answer her, with the respect which was due
      to that all-atoning ignorance. His silence amazed and frightened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I said anything to make you angry with me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius hesitated no longer. &ldquo;My poor girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I pity you from the
      bottom of my heart! Sleep well, Simple Sally&mdash;sleep well.&rdquo; He left
      her hurriedly, and shut the door between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed him as far as the closed door; and stood there alone, trying
      to understand him, and trying all in vain! After a while, she found
      courage enough to whisper through the door. &ldquo;If you please, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
       She stopped, startled by her own boldness. He never heard her; he was
      standing at the window, looking out thoughtfully at the night; feeling
      less confident of the future already. She still stood at the door,
      wretched in the firm persuasion that she had offended him. Once she lifted
      her hand to knock at the door, and let it drop again at her side. A second
      time she made the effort, and desperately summoned the resolution to
      knock. He opened the door directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry if I said anything wrong,&rdquo; she began faintly, her breath
      coming and going in quick hysteric gasps. &ldquo;Please forgive me, and wish me
      good night.&rdquo; Amelius took her hand; he said good night with the utmost
      gentleness, but he said it sorrowfully. She was not quite comforted yet.
      &ldquo;Would you mind, sir&mdash;?&rdquo; She paused awkwardly, afraid to go on. There
      was something so completely childlike in the artless perplexity of her
      eyes, that Amelius smiled. The change in his expression gave her back her
      courage in an instant; her pale delicate lips reflected his smile
      prettily. &ldquo;Would you mind giving me a kiss, sir?&rdquo; she said. Amelius kissed
      her. Let the man who can honestly say he would have done otherwise, blame
      him. He shut the door between them once more. She was quite happy now. He
      heard her singing to herself as she got ready for bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, in the wakeful watches of the night, she startled him. He heard a
      cry of pain or terror in the bedroom. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked through the
      door; &ldquo;what has frightened you?&rdquo; There was no answer. After a minute or
      two, the cry was repeated. He opened the door, and looked in. She was
      sleeping, and dreaming as she slept. One little thin white arm was lifted
      in the air, and waved restlessly to and fro over her head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill
      me!&rdquo; she murmured, in low moaning tones&mdash;&ldquo;oh, don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo; Amelius
      took her arm gently, and laid it back on the coverlet of the bed. His
      touch seemed to exercise some calming influence over her: she sighed, and
      turned her head on the pillow; a faint flush rose on her wasted cheeks,
      and passed away again&mdash;she sank quietly into dreamless sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius returned to his sofa, and fell into a broken slumber. The hours of
      the night passed. The sad light of the November morning dawned mistily
      through the uncurtained window, and woke him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started up, and looked at the bedroom door. &ldquo;Now what is to be done?&rdquo;
       That was his first thought, on waking: he was beginning to feel his
      responsibilities at last.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The landlady of the lodgings decided what was to be done.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be so good, sir, as to leave my apartments immediately,&rdquo; she
      said to Amelius. &ldquo;I make no claim to the week&rsquo;s rent, in consideration of
      the short notice. This is a respectable house, and it shall be kept
      respectable at any sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius explained and protested; he appealed to the landlady&rsquo;s sense of
      justice and sense of duty, as a Christian woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reasoning which would have been irresistible at Tadmor was reasoning
      completely thrown away in London. The landlady remained as impenetrable as
      the Egyptian Sphinx. &ldquo;If that creature in the bedroom is not out of my
      house in an hour&rsquo;s time, I shall send for the police.&rdquo; Having answered her
      lodger&rsquo;s arguments in those terms, she left the room, and banged the door
      after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, for being so kind to me. I&rsquo;ll go away directly&mdash;and
      then, perhaps, the lady will forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked round. Simple Sally had heard it all. She was dressed in
      her wretched clothes, and was standing at the open bedroom door, crying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a little,&rdquo; said Amelius, wiping her eyes with his own handkerchief;
      &ldquo;and we will go away together. I want to get you some better clothes; and
      I don&rsquo;t exactly know how to set about it. Don&rsquo;t cry, my dear&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deaf maid-of-all-work came in, as he spoke. She too was in tears.
      Amelius had been good to her, in many little ways&mdash;and she was the
      guilty person who had led to the discovery in the bedroom. &ldquo;If you had
      only told me, sir,&rdquo; she said pentitently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have kep&rsquo; it secret. But,
      there, I went in with your &lsquo;ot water, as usual, and, O Lor&rsquo;, I was that
      startled I dropped the jug, and run downstairs again&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius stopped the further progress of the apology. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you,
      Maria,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a difficulty. Help me out of it; and you will do
      me a kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maria partially heard him, and no more. Afraid of reaching the landlady&rsquo;s
      ears, as well as the maid&rsquo;s ears, if he raised his voice, he asked if she
      could read writing. Yes, she could read writing, if it was plain. Amelius
      immediately reduced the expression of his necessities to writing, in large
      text. Maria was delighted. She knew the nearest shop at which ready-made
      outer clothing for women could be obtained, and nothing was wanted, as a
      certain guide to an ignorant man, but two pieces of string. With one
      piece, she measured Simple Sally&rsquo;s height, and with the other she took the
      slender girth of the girl&rsquo;s waist&mdash;while Amelius opened his
      writing-desk, and supplied himself with the last sum of spare money that
      he possessed. He had just closed the desk again, when the voice of the
      merciless landlady was heard, calling imperatively for Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid-of-all-work handed the two indicative strings to Amelius.
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll &lsquo;elp you at the shop,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and shuffled out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius turned to Simple Sally. &ldquo;I am going to get you some new clothes,&rdquo;
       he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stopped him there: she was incapable of listening to a word more.
      Every trace of sorrow vanished from her face in an instant. She clapped
      her hands. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;new clothes! clean clothes! Let me go with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Amelius saw that it was impossible to take her out in the streets
      with him in broad daylight, dressed as she was then. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;wait here till you get your new things. I won&rsquo;t be half an hour gone.
      Lock yourself in if you&rsquo;re afraid, and open the door to nobody till I come
      back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally hesitated; she began to look frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of the new dress, and the pretty bonnet,&rdquo; suggested Amelius,
      speaking unconsciously in the tone in which he might have promised a toy
      to a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken the right way with her. Her face brightened again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do
      anything you tell me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the key in her hand, and was out in the street directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius possessed one valuable moral quality which is exceedingly rare
      among Englishmen. He was not in the least ashamed of putting himself in a
      ridiculous position, when he was conscious that his own motives justified
      him. The smiling and tittering of the shop-women, when he stated the
      nature of his errand, and produced his two pieces of string, failed to
      annoy him in the smallest degree. He laughed too. &ldquo;Funny, isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;a man like me buying gowns and the rest of it? She can&rsquo;t come
      herself&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll advise me, like good creatures, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; They
      advised their handsome young customer to such good purpose, that he was in
      possession of a gray walking costume, a black cloth jacket, a plain
      lavender-coloured bonnet, a pair of black gloves, and a paper of pins, in
      little more than ten minutes&rsquo; time. The nearest trunk-maker supplied a
      travelling-box to hold all these treasures; and a passing cab took Amelius
      back to his lodgings, just as the half-hour was out. But one event had
      happened during his absence. The landlady had knocked at the door, had
      called through it in a terrible voice, &ldquo;Half an hour more!&rdquo; and had
      retired again without waiting for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius carried the box into the bedroom. &ldquo;Be as quick as you can, Sally,&rdquo;
       he said&mdash;and left her alone, to enjoy the full rapture of discovering
      the new clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she opened the door and showed herself, the change was so wonderful
      that Amelius was literally unable to speak to her. Joy flushed her pale
      cheeks, and diffused its tender radiance over her pure blue eyes. A more
      charming little creature, in that momentary transfiguration of pride and
      delight, no man&rsquo;s eyes ever looked on. She ran across the room to Amelius,
      and threw her arms round his neck. &ldquo;Let me be your servant!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I
      want to live with you all my life. Jump me up! I&rsquo;m wild&mdash;I want to
      fly through the window.&rdquo; She caught sight of herself in the looking-glass,
      and suddenly became composed and serious. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, with the
      quaintest mixture of awe and astonishment, &ldquo;was there ever such another
      bonnet as this? Do look at it&mdash;do please look at it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius good-naturedly approached to look at it. At the same moment the
      sitting-room door was opened, without any preliminary ceremony of knocking&mdash;and
      Rufus walked into the room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s half after ten,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the
      breakfast is spoiling as fast as it can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Amelius could make his excuses for having completely forgotten his
      engagement, Rufus discovered Sally. No woman, young or old, high in rank
      or low in rank, ever found the New Englander unprepared with his own
      characteristic acknowledgment of the debt of courtesy which he owed to the
      sex. With his customary vast strides, he marched up to Sally and insisted
      on shaking hands with her. &ldquo;How do you find yourself, miss? I take
      pleasure in making your acquaintance.&rdquo; The girl turned to Amelius with
      wide-eyed wonder and doubt. &ldquo;Go into the next room, Sally, for a minute or
      two,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This gentleman is a friend of mine, and I have something
      to say to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an <i>active</i> little girl,&rdquo; said Rufus, looking after her as
      she ran to the friendly shelter of the bedroom. &ldquo;Reminds me of one of our
      girls at Coolspring&mdash;she does. Well, now, and who may Sally be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius answered the question, as usual, without the slightest reserve.
      Rufus waited in impenetrable silence until he had completed his narrative&mdash;then
      took him gently by the arm, and led him to the window. With his hands in
      his pockets and his long legs planted wide apart on his big feet, the
      American carefully studied the face of his young friend under the
      strongest light that could fall on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rufus, speaking quietly to himself, &ldquo;the boy is not raving mad,
      so far as I can see. He has every appearance on him of meaning what he
      says. And this is what comes of the Community of Tadmor, is it? Well,
      civil and religious liberty is dearly purchased sometimes in the United
      States&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius turned away to pack his portmanteau. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you do,&rdquo; Rufus remarked. &ldquo;I am at a similar loss myself
      to understand <i>you.</i> My store of sensible remarks is copious on most
      occasions&mdash;but I&rsquo;m darned if I ain&rsquo;t dried up in the face of this!
      Might I venture to ask what that venerable Chief Christian at Tadmor would
      say to the predicament in which I find my young Socialist this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would he say?&rdquo; Amelius repeated. &ldquo;Just what he said when Mellicent
      first came among us. &lsquo;Ah, dear me! Another of the Fallen Leaves!&rsquo; I wish I
      had the dear old man here to help me. <i>He</i> would know how to restore
      that poor starved, outraged, beaten creature to the happy place on God&rsquo;s
      earth which God intended her to fill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus abruptly took him by the hand. &ldquo;You mean that?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else could I mean?&rdquo; Amelius rejoined sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring her right away to breakfast at the hotel!&rdquo; cried Rufus, with every
      appearance of feeling infinitely relieved. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say I can supply you
      with the venerable Chief Christian&mdash;but I can find a woman to fix
      you, who is as nigh to being an angel, barring the wings, as any
      she-creature since the time of mother Eve.&rdquo; He knocked at the bedroom
      door, turning a deaf ear to every appeal for further information which
      Amelius could address to him. &ldquo;Breakfast is waiting, miss!&rdquo; he called out;
      &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m bound to tell you that the temper of the cook at our hotel is a
      long way on the wrong side of uncertain. Well, Amelius, this is the age of
      exhibition. If there&rsquo;s ever an exhibition of ignorance in the business of
      packing a portmanteau, you run for the Gold Medal&mdash;and a unanimous
      jury will vote it, I reckon, to a young man from Tadmor. Clear out, will
      you, and leave it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled off his coat, and conquered the difficulties of packing in a
      hurry, as if he had done nothing else all his life. The landlady herself,
      appearing with pitiless punctuality exactly at the expiration of the hour,
      &ldquo;smoothed her horrid front&rdquo; in the polite and placable presence of Rufus.
      He insisted on shaking hands with her; he took pleasure in making her
      acquaintance; she reminded him, he did assure her, of the lady of the
      captain-general of the Coolspring Branch of the St. Vitus Commandery; and
      he would take the liberty to inquire whether they were related or not.
      Under cover of this fashionable conversation, Simple Sally was taken out
      of the room by Amelius without attracting notice. She insisted on carrying
      her threadbare old clothes away with her in the box which had contained
      the new dress. &ldquo;I want to look at them sometimes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and think
      how much better off I am now.&rdquo; Rufus was the last to take his departure;
      he persisted in talking to the landlady all the way down the stairs and
      out to the street door.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Amelius was waiting for his friend on the house-steps, a young man
      driving by in a cab leaned out and looked at him. The young man was Jervy,
      on his way from Mr. Ronald&rsquo;s tombstone to Doctors&rsquo; Commons.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      With a rapid succession of events the morning had begun. With a rapid
      succession of events the day went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast being over, rooms at the hotel were engaged by Rufus for his
      &ldquo;two young friends.&rdquo; After this, the next thing to be done was to provide
      Simple Sally with certain necessary, but invisible, articles of clothing,
      which Amelius had never thought of. A note to the nearest shop produced
      the speedy arrival of a smart lady, accompanied by a boy and a large
      basket. There was some difficulty in persuading Sally to trust herself
      alone in her room with the stranger. She was afraid, poor soul, of
      everybody but Amelius. Even the good American failed to win her
      confidence. The distrust implanted in her feeble mind by the terrible life
      that she had led, was the instinctive distrust of a wild animal. &ldquo;Why must
      I go among other people?&rdquo; she whispered piteously to Amelius. &ldquo;I only want
      to be with You!&rdquo; It was as completely useless to reason with her as it
      would have been to explain the advantages of a comfortable cage to a newly
      caught bird. There was but one way of inducing her to submit to the most
      gently exerted interference. Amelius had only to say, &ldquo;Do it, Sally, to
      please me.&rdquo; And Sally sighed, and did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her absence Amelius reiterated his inquiries, in relation to that
      unknown friend whom Rufus had not scrupled to describe as &ldquo;an angel&mdash;barring
      the wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady in question, the American briefly explained, was an Englishwoman&mdash;the
      wife of one of his countrymen, established in London as a merchant. He had
      known them both intimately before their departure from the United States;
      and the old friendship had been cordially renewed on his arrival in
      England. Associated with many other charitable institutions, Mrs. Payson
      was one of the managing committee of a &ldquo;Home for Friendless Women,&rdquo;
       especially adapted to receive poor girls in Sally&rsquo;s melancholy position.
      Rufus offered to write a note to Mrs. Payson; inquiring at what hour she
      could receive his friend and himself, and obtain permission for them to
      see the &ldquo;Home.&rdquo; Amelius, after some hesitation, accepted the proposal. The
      messenger had not been long despatched with the note before the smart
      person from the shop made her appearance once more, reporting that &ldquo;the
      young lady&rsquo;s outfit had been perfectly arranged,&rdquo; and presenting the
      inevitable result in the shape of a bill. The last farthing of ready money
      in the possession of Amelius proved to be insufficient to discharge the
      debt. He accepted a loan from Rufus, until he could give his bankers the
      necessary order to sell out some of his money invested in the Funds. His
      answer, when Rufus protested against this course, was characteristic of
      the teaching which he owed to the Community. &ldquo;My dear fellow, I am bound
      to return the money you have lent to me&mdash;in the interests of our poor
      brethren. The next friend who borrows of you may not have the means of
      paying you back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After waiting for the return of Simple Sally, and waiting in vain, Amelius
      sent a chambermaid to her room, with a message to her. Rufus disapproved
      of this hasty proceeding. &ldquo;Why disturb the girl at her looking-glass?&rdquo;
       asked the old bachelor, with his quaintly humorous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally came in with no bright pleasure in her eyes this time; the girl
      looked worn and haggard. She drew Amelius away into a corner, and
      whispered to him. &ldquo;I get a pain sometimes where the bruise is,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got it bad, now.&rdquo; She glanced, with an odd furtive jealousy, at
      Rufus. &ldquo;I kept away from you,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;because I didn&rsquo;t want <i>him</i>
      to know.&rdquo; She stopped, and put her hand on her bosom, and clenched her
      teeth fast. &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; she said cheerfully, as the pang passed away
      again; &ldquo;I can bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius, acting on impulse, as usual, instantly ordered the most
      comfortable carriage that the hotel possessed. He had heard terrible
      stories of the possible result of an injury to a woman&rsquo;s bosom. &ldquo;I shall
      take her to the best doctor in London,&rdquo; he announced. Sally whispered to
      him again&mdash;still with her eye on Rufus. &ldquo;Is <i>he</i> going with us?&rdquo;
       she asked. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Amelius; &ldquo;one of us must stay here to receive a
      message.&rdquo; Rufus looked after them very gravely, as the two left the room
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Applying for information to the mistress of the hotel, Amelius obtained
      the address of a consulting surgeon of great celebrity, while Sally was
      getting ready to go out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you like my good friend upstairs?&rdquo; he said to the girl as they
      drove away from the house. The answer came swift and straight from the
      heart of the daughter of Eve. &ldquo;Because <i>you</i> like him!&rdquo; Amelius
      changed the subject: he asked if she was still in pain. She shook her head
      impatiently. Pain or no pain, the uppermost idea in her mind was still
      that idea of being his servant, which had already found expression in
      words before they left the lodgings. &ldquo;Will you let me keep my beautiful
      new dress for going out on Sundays?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;The shabby old things
      will do when I am your servant. I can black your boots, and brush your
      clothes, and keep your room tidy&mdash;and I will try hard to learn, if
      you will have me taught to cook.&rdquo; Amelius attempted to change the subject
      again. He might as well have talked to her in an unknown tongue. The
      glorious prospect of being his servant absorbed the whole of her
      attention. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m little and I&rsquo;m stupid,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;but I do think I
      could learn to cook, if I knew I was doing it for <i>You.&rdquo;</i> She paused,
      and looked at him anxiously. &ldquo;Do let me try!&rdquo; she pleaded; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had
      much pleasure in my life&mdash;and I should like it so!&rdquo; It was impossible
      to resist this. &ldquo;You shall be as happy as I can make you, Sally,&rdquo; Amelius
      answered; &ldquo;God knows it isn&rsquo;t much you ask for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in those compassionate words set her thinking in another
      direction. It was sad to see how slowly and painfully she realized the
      idea that had been suggested to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether you <i>can</i> make me happy?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I suppose I
      have been happy before this&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know when. I don&rsquo;t remember
      a time when I was not hungry or cold. Wait a bit. I do think I <i>was</i>
      happy once. It was a long while ago, and it took me a weary time to do it&mdash;but
      I did learn at last to play a tune on the fiddle. The old man and his wife
      took it in turns to teach me. Somebody gave me to the old man and his
      wife; I don&rsquo;t know who it was, and I don&rsquo;t remember their names. They were
      musicians. In the fine streets they sang hymns, and in the poor streets
      they sang comic songs. It was cold, to be sure, standing barefoot on the
      pavement&mdash;but I got plenty of halfpence. The people said I was so
      little it was a shame to send me out, and so I got halfpence. I had bread
      and apples for supper, and a nice little corner under the staircase, to
      sleep in. Do you know, I do think I did enjoy myself at that time,&rdquo; she
      concluded, still a little doubtful whether those faint and far-off
      remembrances were really to be relied on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius tried to lead her to other recollections. He asked her how old she
      was when she played the fiddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how old I am now. I don&rsquo;t
      remember anything before the fiddle. I can&rsquo;t call to mind how long it was
      first&mdash;but there came a time when the old man and his wife got into
      trouble. They went to prison, and I never saw them afterwards. I ran away
      with the fiddle; to get the halfpence, you know, all to myself. I think I
      should have got a deal of money, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the boys. They&rsquo;re
      so cruel, the boys are. They broke my fiddle. I tried selling pencils
      after that; but people didn&rsquo;t seem to want pencils. They found me out
      begging. I got took up, and brought before the what-do-you-call-him&mdash;the
      gentleman who sits in a high place, you know, behind a desk. Oh, but I was
      frightened, when they took me before the gentleman! He looked very much
      puzzled. He says, &lsquo;Bring her up here; she&rsquo;s so small I can hardly see
      her.&rsquo; He says, &lsquo;Good God! what am I to do with this unfortunate child?&rsquo; 
      There was plenty of people about. One of them says, &lsquo;The workhouse ought
      to take her.&rsquo; And a lady came in, and she says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take her, sir, if
      you&rsquo;ll let me.&rsquo; And he knew her, and he let her. She took me to a place
      they called a Refuge&mdash;for wandering children, you know. It was very
      strict at the Refuge. They did give us plenty to eat, to be sure, and they
      taught us lessons. They told us about Our Father up in Heaven. I said a
      wrong thing&mdash;I said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want him up in Heaven; I want him down
      here.&rsquo; They were very much ashamed of me when I said that. I was a bad
      girl; I turned ungrateful. After a time, I ran away. You see, it was so
      strict, and I was so used to the streets. I met with a Scotchman in the
      streets. He wore a kilt, and played the pipes; he taught me to dance, and
      dressed me up like a Scotch girl. He had a curious wife, a sort of
      half-black woman. She used to dance too&mdash;on a bit of carpet, you
      know, so as not to spoil her fine shoes. They taught me songs; he taught
      me a Scotch song. And one day his wife said <i>she</i> was English (I
      don&rsquo;t know how that was, being a half-black woman), and I should learn an
      English song. And they quarrelled about it. And she had her way. She
      taught me &lsquo;Sally in our Alley&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s how I come to be called Sally. I
      hadn&rsquo;t any name of my own&mdash;I always had nicknames. Sally was the last
      of them, and Sally has stuck to me. I hope it isn&rsquo;t too common a name to
      please you? Oh, what a fine house! Are we really going in? Will they let
      <i>me</i> in? How stupid I am! I forgot my beautiful clothes. You won&rsquo;t
      tell them, will you, if they take me for a lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage had stopped at the great surgeon&rsquo;s house: the waiting-room
      was full of patients. Some of them were trying to read the books and
      newspapers on the table; and some of them were looking at each other, not
      only without the slightest sympathy, but occasionally even with downright
      distrust and dislike. Amelius took up a newspaper, and gave Sally an
      illustrated book to amuse her, while they waited to see the Surgeon in
      their turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two long hours passed, before the servant summoned Amelius to the
      consulting-room. Sally was wearily asleep in her chair. He left her
      undisturbed, having questions to put relating to the imperfectly developed
      state of her mind, which could not be asked in her presence. The surgeon
      listened, with no ordinary interest, to the young stranger&rsquo;s simple and
      straightforward narrative of what had happened on the previous night. &ldquo;You
      are very unlike other young men,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;may I ask how you have been
      brought up?&rdquo; The reply surprised him. &ldquo;This opens quite a new view of
      Socialism,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought your conduct highly imprudent at first&mdash;it
      seems to be the natural result of your teaching now. Let me see what I can
      do to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very grave and very gentle, when Sally was presented to him. His
      opinion of the injury to her bosom relieved the anxiety of Amelius: there
      might be pain for some little time to come, but there were no serious
      consequences to fear. Having written his prescription, and having put
      several questions to Sally, the surgeon sent her back, with marked
      kindness of manner, to wait for Amelius in the patients&rsquo; room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have young daughters of my own,&rdquo; he said, when the door was closed;
      &ldquo;and I cannot but feel for that unhappy creature, when I contrast her life
      with theirs. So far as I can see it, the natural growth of her senses&mdash;her
      higher and her lower senses alike&mdash;has been stunted, like the natural
      growth of her body, by starvation, terror, exposure to cold, and other
      influences inherent in the life that she has led. With nourishing food,
      pure air, and above all kind and careful treatment, I see no reason, at
      her age, why she should not develop into an intelligent and healthy young
      woman. Pardon me if I venture on giving you a word of advice. At your time
      of life, you will do well to place her at once under competent and proper
      care. You may live to regret it, if you are too confident in your own good
      motives in such a case as this. Come to me again, if I can be of any use
      to you. No,&rdquo; he continued, refusing to take his fee; &ldquo;my help to that poor
      lost girl is help given freely.&rdquo; He shook hands with Amelius&mdash;a
      worthy member of the noble order to which he belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon&rsquo;s parting advice, following on the quaint protest of Rufus,
      had its effect on Amelius. He was silent and thoughtful when he got into
      the carriage again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple Sally looked at him with a vague sense of alarm. Her heart beat
      fast, under the perpetually recurring fear that she had done something or
      said something to offend him. &ldquo;Was it bad behaviour in me,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;to
      fall asleep in the chair?&rdquo; Reassured, so far, she was still as anxious as
      ever to get at the truth. After long hesitation, and long previous
      thought, she ventured to try another question. &ldquo;The gentleman sent me out
      of the room&mdash;did he say anything to set you against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman said everything that was kind of you,&rdquo; Amelius replied,
      &ldquo;and everything to make me hope that you will live to be a happy girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing to that; vague assurances were no assurances to her&mdash;she
      only looked at him with the dumb fidelity of a dog. Suddenly, she dropped
      on her knees in the carriage, hid her face in her hands, and cried
      silently. Surprised and distressed, he attempted to raise her and console
      her. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said obstinately. &ldquo;Something has happened to vex you, and
      you won&rsquo;t tell me what it is. Do, do, do tell me what it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; said Amelius, &ldquo;I was only thinking anxiously about you,
      in the time to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him quickly. &ldquo;What! have you forgotten already?&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to be your servant in the time to come.&rdquo; She dried her
      eyes, and took her place again joyously by his side. &ldquo;You did frighten
      me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and all for nothing. But you didn&rsquo;t mean it, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An older man might have had the courage to undeceive her: Amelius shrank
      from it. He tried to lead her back to the melancholy story&mdash;so common
      and so terrible; so pitiable in its utter absence of sentiment or romance&mdash;the
      story of her past life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, with that quick insight where her feelings were
      concerned, which was the only quick insight that she possessed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      like making you sorry; and you did look sorry&mdash;you did&mdash;when I
      talked about it before. The streets, the streets, the streets; little
      girl, or big girl, it&rsquo;s only the streets; and always being hungry or cold;
      and cruel men when it isn&rsquo;t cruel boys. I want to be happy! I want to
      enjoy my new clothes! You tell me about your own self. What makes you so
      kind? I can&rsquo;t make it out; try as I may, I can&rsquo;t make it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some time elapsed before they got back to the hotel. Amelius drove as far
      as the City, to give the necessary instructions to his bankers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to the sitting-room at last, he discovered that his American
      friend was not alone. A gray-haired lady with a bright benevolent face was
      talking earnestly to Rufus. The instant Sally discovered the stranger, she
      started back, fled to the shelter of her bedchamber, and locked herself
      in. Amelius, entering the room after a little hesitation, was presented to
      Mrs. Payson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was something in my old friend&rsquo;s note,&rdquo; said the lady, smiling and
      turning to Rufus, &ldquo;which suggested to me that I should do well to answer
      it personally. I am not too old yet to follow the impulse of the moment,
      sometimes; and I am very glad that I did so. I have heard what is, to me,
      a very interesting story. Mr. Goldenheart, I respect you! And I will prove
      it by helping you, with all my heart and soul, to save that poor little
      girl who has just run away from me. Pray don&rsquo;t make excuses for her; I
      should have run away too, at her age. We have arranged,&rdquo; she continued,
      looking again at Rufus, &ldquo;that I shall take you both to the Home, this
      afternoon. If we can prevail on Sally to go with us, one serious obstacle
      in our way will be overcome. Tell me the number of her room. I want to try
      if I can&rsquo;t make friends with her. I have had some experience; and I don&rsquo;t
      despair of bringing her back here, hand in hand with the terrible person
      who has frightened her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men were left together. Amelius attempted to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it down,&rdquo; said Rufus; &ldquo;no premature outbreak of opinion, if you
      please, yet awhile. Wait till she has fixed Sally, and shown us the
      Paradise of the poor girls. It&rsquo;s within the London postal district, and
      that&rsquo;s all I know about it. Well, now, and did you go to the doctor?
      Thunder! what&rsquo;s come to the boy? Seems as though he had left his
      complexion in the carriage! He looks, I do declare, as if he wanted
      medical tinkering himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius explained that his past night had been a wakeful one, and that the
      events of the day had not allowed him any opportunities of repose. &ldquo;Since
      the morning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;things have hurried so, one on the top of the
      other, that I am beginning to feel a little dazed and weary.&rdquo; Without a
      word of remark, Rufus produced the remedy. The materials were ready on the
      sideboard&mdash;he made a cocktail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another?&rdquo; asked the New Englander, after a reasonable lapse of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius declined taking another. He stretched himself on the sofa; his
      good friend considerately took up a newspaper. For the first time that
      day, he had now the prospect of a quiet interval for rest and thought. In
      less than a minute the delusive prospect vanished. He started to his feet
      again, disturbed by a new anxiety. Having leisure to think, he had thought
      of Regina. &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s waiting to see me&mdash;and
      I never remembered it till this moment!&rdquo; He looked at his watch: it was
      five o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; he said helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus laid down the newspaper, and considered the new difficulty in its
      various aspects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are bound to go with Mrs. Payson to the Home,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and, I tell
      you this, Amelius, the matter of Sally is not a matter to be played with;
      it&rsquo;s a thing that&rsquo;s got to be done. In your place I should write politely
      to Miss Regina, and put it off till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, a man who took Rufus for his
      counsellor was a man who acted wisely in every sense of the word. Events,
      however, of which Amelius and his friend were both ignorant alike, had so
      ordered it, that the American&rsquo;s well-meant advice, in this one exceptional
      case, was the very worst advice that could have been given. In an hour
      more, Jervy and Mrs. Sowler were to meet at the tavern door. The one last
      hope of protecting Mrs. Farnaby from the abominable conspiracy of which
      she was the destined victim, rested solely on the fulfilment by Amelius of
      his engagement with Regina for that day. Always ready to interfere with
      the progress of the courtship, Mrs. Farnaby would be especially eager to
      seize the first opportunity of speaking to her young Socialist friend on
      the subject of his lecture. In the course of the talk between them, the
      idea which, in the present disturbed state of his mind, had not struck him
      yet&mdash;the idea that the outcast of the streets might, by the barest
      conceivable possibility, be identified with the lost daughter&mdash;would,
      in one way or another, be almost infallibly suggested to Amelius; and, at
      the eleventh hour, the conspiracy would be foiled. If, on the other hand,
      the American&rsquo;s fatal advice was followed, the next morning&rsquo;s post might
      bring a letter from Jervy to Mrs. Farnaby&mdash;with this disastrous
      result. At the first words spoken by Amelius, she would put an end to all
      further interest in the subject on his part, by telling him that the lost
      girl had been found, and found by another person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus pointed to the writing-materials on a side table, which he had
      himself used earlier in the day. The needful excuse was, unhappily, quite
      easy to find. A misunderstanding with his landlady had obliged Amelius to
      leave his lodgings at an hour&rsquo;s notice, and had occupied him in trying to
      find a new residence for the rest of the day. The note was written. Rufus,
      who was nearest to the bell, stretched out his hand to ring for the
      messenger. Amelius suddenly stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t like me to disappoint her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t stay long&mdash;I
      might get there and back in half an hour, in a fast cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His conscience was not quite easy. The sense of having forgotten Regina&mdash;no
      matter how naturally and excusably&mdash;oppressed him with a feeling of
      self-reproach. Rufus raised no objection; the hesitation of Amelius was
      unquestionably creditable to him. &ldquo;If you must do it, my son,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;do it right away&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll wait for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius took up his hat. The door opened as he approached it, and Mrs.
      Payson entered the room, leading Simple Sally by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all going together,&rdquo; said the genial old lady, &ldquo;to see my large
      family of daughters at the Home. We can have our talk in the carriage.
      It&rsquo;s an hour&rsquo;s drive from this place&mdash;and I must be back again to
      dinner at half-past seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius and Rufus looked at each other. Amelius thought of pleading an
      engagement, and asking to be excused. Under the circumstances, it was
      assuredly not a very gracious thing to do. Before he could make up his
      mind, one way or the other, Sally stole to his side, and put her hand on
      his arm. Mrs. Payson had done wonders in conquering the girl&rsquo;s inveterate
      distrust of strangers, and, to a certain extent at least, winning her
      confidence. But no early influence could shake Sally&rsquo;s dog-like devotion
      to Amelius. Her jealous instinct discovered something suspicious in his
      sudden silence. &ldquo;You must go with us,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Mrs. Payson added; &ldquo;I promised her that, of course,
      beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus rang the bell, and despatched the messenger to Regina. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
      one way out of it, my son,&rdquo; he whispered to Amelius, as they followed Mrs.
      Payson and Sally down the stairs of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had just driven up to the gates of the Home, when Jervy and his
      accomplice met at the tavern, and entered on their consultation in a
      private room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her poverty-stricken appearance, Mrs. Sowler was not
      absolutely destitute. In various underhand and wicked ways, she contrived
      to put a few shillings in her pocket from week to week. If she was half
      starved, it was for the very ordinary reason, among persons of her vicious
      class, that she preferred spending her money on drink. Stating his
      business with her, as reservedly and as cunningly as usual, Jervy found,
      to his astonishment, that even this squalid old creature presumed to
      bargain with him. The two wretches were on the point of a quarrel which
      might have delayed the execution of the plot against Mrs. Farnaby, but for
      the vile self-control which made Jervy one of the most formidable
      criminals living. He gave way on the question of money&mdash;and, from
      that moment, he had Mrs. Sowler absolutely at his disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meet me to-morrow morning, to receive your instructions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
      time is ten sharp; and the place is the powder-magazine in Hyde Park. And
      mind this! You must be decently dressed&mdash;you know where to hire the
      things. If I smell you of spirits to-morrow morning, I shall employ
      somebody else. No; not a farthing now. You will have your money&mdash;first
      instalment only, mind!&mdash;to-morrow at ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left by himself, Jervy sent for pen, ink, and paper. Using his left hand,
      which was just as serviceable to him as his right, he traced these lines:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are informed, by an unknown friend, that a certain lost young lady is
      now living in a foreign country, and may be restored to her afflicted
      mother on receipt of a sufficient sum to pay expenses, and to reward the
      writer of this letter, who is undeservedly, in distressed circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you, madam, the mother? I ask the question in the strictest
      confidence, knowing nothing certainly but that your husband was the person
      who put the young lady out to nurse in her infancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t address your husband, because his inhuman desertion of the poor
      baby does not incline me to trust him. I run the risk of trusting you&mdash;to
      a certain extent&mdash;at starting. Shall I drop a hint which may help you
      to identify the child, in your own mind? It would be inexcusably foolish
      on my part to speak too plainly, just yet. The hint must be a vague one.
      Suppose I use a poetical expression, and say that the young lady is
      enveloped in mystery from head to foot&mdash;especially the foot?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the event of my addressing the right person, I beg to offer a
      suggestion for a preliminary interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will take a walk on the bridge over the Serpentine River, on
      Kensington Gardens side, at half-past ten o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning,
      holding a white handkerchief in your left hand, you will meet the
      much-injured woman, who was deceived into taking charge of the infant
      child at Ramsgate, and will be satisfied so far that you are giving your
      confidence to persons who really deserve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jervy addressed this infamous letter to Mrs. Farnaby, in an ordinary
      envelope, marked &ldquo;Private.&rdquo; He posted it, that night, with his own hand.

      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Rufus! I don&rsquo;t quite like the way you look at me. You seem to think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it tongue, my son. What do I seem to think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m forgetting Regina. You don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m just as fond of
      her as ever. The fact is, you&rsquo;re an old bachelor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so. Where&rsquo;s the harm, Amelius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re out there, my bright boy. I reckon I understand more than you
      think for. The wisest thing you ever did in your life is what you did this
      evening, when you committed Sally to the care of those ladies at the
      Home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Rufus. We shall quarrel if I stay here any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Amelius. We shan&rsquo;t quarrel, stay here as long as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good deed had been done; the sacrifice&mdash;already a painful
      sacrifice&mdash;had been made. Mrs. Payson was old enough to speak
      plainly, as well as seriously, to Amelius of the absolute necessity of
      separating himself from Simple Sally, without any needless delay. &ldquo;You
      have seen for yourself,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the plan on which this little
      household is ruled is the unvarying plan of patience and kindness. So far
      as Sally is concerned, you can be quite sure that she will never hear a
      harsh word, never meet with a hard look, while she is under our care. The
      lamentable neglect under which the poor creature has suffered, will be
      tenderly remembered and atoned for, here. If we can&rsquo;t make her happy among
      us, I promise that she shall leave the Home, if she wishes it, in six
      weeks&rsquo; time. As to yourself, consider your position if you persist in
      taking her back with you. Our good friend Rufus has told me that you are
      engaged to be married. Think of the misinterpretations, to say the least
      of it, to which you would subject yourself&mdash;think of the reports
      which would sooner or later find their way to the young lady&rsquo;s ears, and
      of the deplorable consequences that would follow. I believe implicitly in
      the purity of your motives. But remember Who taught us to pray that we may
      not be led into temptation&mdash;and complete the good work that you have
      begun, by leaving Sally among friends and sisters in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To any honourable man, these were unanswerable words. Coming after what
      Rufus and the surgeon had already said to him, they left Amelius no
      alternative but to yield. He pleaded for leave to write to Sally, and to
      see her, at a later interval, when she might be reconciled to her new
      life. Mrs. Payson had just consented to both requests, Rufus had just
      heartily congratulated him on his decision&mdash;when the door was thrown
      violently open. Simple Sally ran into the room, followed by one of the
      women-attendants in a state of breathless surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She showed me a bedroom,&rdquo; cried Sally, pointing indignantly to the woman;
      &ldquo;and she asked if I should like to sleep there.&rdquo; She turned to Amelius,
      and caught him by the hand to lead him away. The ineradicable instinct of
      distrust had been once more roused in her by the too zealous attendant.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stay here,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away with You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius glanced at Mrs. Payson. Sally tried to drag him to the door. He
      did his best to reassure her by a smile; he spoke confusedly some
      composing words. But his honest face, always accustomed to tell the truth,
      told the truth now. The poor lost creature, whose feeble intelligence was
      so slow to discern, so inapt to reflect, looked at him with the heart&rsquo;s
      instantaneous perception, and saw her doom. She let go of his hand. Her
      head sank. Without word or cry, she dropped on the floor at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendant instantly raised her, and placed her on a sofa. Mrs. Payson
      saw how resolutely Amelius struggled to control himself, and felt for him
      with all her heart. Turning aside for a moment, she hastily wrote a few
      lines, and returned to him. &ldquo;Go, before we revive her,&rdquo; she whispered;
      &ldquo;and give what I have written to the coachman. You shall suffer no anxiety
      that I can spare you,&rdquo; said the excellent woman; &ldquo;I will stay here myself
      to-night, and reconcile her to the new life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand; Amelius kissed it in silence. Rufus led him out.
      Not a word dropped from his lips on the long drive back to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind was disturbed by other subjects besides the subject of Sally. He
      thought of his future, darkened by the doubtful marriage-engagement that
      was before him. Alone with Rufus, for the rest of the evening, he
      petulantly misunderstood the sympathy with which the kindly American
      regarded him. Their bedrooms were next to each other. Rufus heard him
      walking restlessly to and fro, and now and then talking to himself. After
      a while, these sounds ceased. He was evidently worn out, and was getting
      the rest that he needed, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he received a few lines from Mrs. Payson, giving a
      favourable account of Sally, and promising further particulars in a day or
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged by this good news, revived by a long night&rsquo;s sleep, he went
      towards noon to pay his postponed visit to Regina. At that early hour, he
      could feel sure that his interview with her would not be interrupted by
      visitors. She received him quietly and seriously, pressing his hand with a
      warmer fondness than usual. He had anticipated some complaint of his
      absence on the previous day, and some severe allusion to his appearance in
      the capacity of a Socialist lecturer. Regina&rsquo;s indulgence, or Regina&rsquo;s
      interest in circumstances of more pressing importance, preserved a
      merciful silence on both subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a comfort to me to see you, Amelius,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I am in trouble
      about my uncle, and I am weary of my own anxious thoughts. Something
      unpleasant has happened in Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s business. He goes to the City
      earlier, and he returns much later, than usual. When he does come back, he
      doesn&rsquo;t speak to me&mdash;he locks himself into his room; and he looks
      worn and haggard when I make his breakfast for him in the morning. You
      know that he is one of the directors of the new bank? There was something
      about the bank in the newspaper yesterday which upset him dreadfully; he
      put down his cup of coffee&mdash;and went away to the City, without eating
      his breakfast. I don&rsquo;t like to worry you about it, Amelius. But my aunt
      seems to take no interest in her husband&rsquo;s affairs&mdash;and it is really
      a relief to me to talk of my troubles to you. I have kept the newspaper;
      do look at what it says about the bank, and tell me if you understand it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius read the passage pointed out to him. He knew as little of banking
      business as Regina. &ldquo;So far as I can make it out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
      paying away money to their shareholders which they haven&rsquo;t earned. How do
      they do that, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina changed the subject in despair. She asked Amelius if he had found
      new lodgings. Hearing that he had not yet succeeded in the search for a
      residence, she opened a drawer of her work-table, and took out a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brother of one of my schoolfellows is going to be married,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;He has a pretty bachelor cottage in the neighbourhood of the Regent&rsquo;s
      Park&mdash;and he wants to sell it, with the furniture, just as it is. I
      don&rsquo;t know whether you care to encumber yourself with a little house of
      your own. His sister has asked me to distribute some of his cards, with
      the address and the particulars. It might be worth your while, perhaps, to
      look at the cottage when you pass that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius took the card. The small feminine restraints and gentlenesses of
      Regina, her quiet even voice, her serene grace of movement, had a
      pleasantly soothing effect on his mind after the anxieties of the last
      four and twenty hours. He looked at her bending over her embroidery,
      deftly and gracefully industrious&mdash;and drew his chair closer to her.
      She smiled softly over her work, conscious that he was admiring her, and
      placidly pleased to receive the tribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would buy the cottage at once,&rdquo; said Amelius, &ldquo;if I thought you would
      come and live in it with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up gravely, with her needle suspended in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us return to that,&rdquo; she answered, and went on again with her
      embroidery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Amelius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She persisted in working, as industriously as if she had been a poor
      needlewoman, with serious reasons for being eager to get her money. &ldquo;It is
      useless,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;to speak of what cannot be for some time to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius stopped the progress of the embroidery by taking her hand. Her
      devotion to her work irritated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me, Regina,&rdquo; he said, steadily controlling himself. &ldquo;I want to
      propose that we shall give way a little on both sides. I won&rsquo;t hurry you;
      I will wait a reasonable time. If I promise that, surely you may yield a
      little in return. Money seems to be a hard taskmaster, my darling, after
      what you have told me about your uncle. See how he suffers because he is
      bent on being rich; and ask yourself if it isn&rsquo;t a warning to us not to
      follow his example! Would you like to see <i>me</i> too wretched to speak
      to you, or to eat my breakfast&mdash;and all for the sake of a little
      outward show? Come, come! let us think of ourselves. Why should we waste
      the best days of our life apart, when we are both free to be happy
      together? I have another good friend besides Rufus&mdash;the good friend
      of my father before me. He knows all sorts of great people, and he will
      help me to some employment. In six months&rsquo; time I might have a little
      salary to add to my income. Say the sweetest words, my darling, that ever
      fell from your lips&mdash;say you will marry me in six months!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not in a woman&rsquo;s nature to be insensible to such pleading as this.
      She all but yielded. &ldquo;I should like to say it, dear!&rdquo; she answered, with a
      little fluttering sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it, then!&rdquo; Amelius suggested tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took refuge again in her embroidery. &ldquo;If you would only give me a
      little time,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;I might say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time for what, my own love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time to wait, dear, till my uncle is not quite so anxious as he is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of your uncle, Regina! You know as well as I do what he would
      say. Good heavens! why can&rsquo;t you decide for yourself? No! I don&rsquo;t want to
      hear over again about what you owe to Mr. Farnaby&mdash;I heard enough of
      it on that day in the shrubbery. Oh, my dear girl, do have some feeling
      for me! do for once have a will of your own!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those last words were an offence to her self-esteem. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s very
      rude to tell me I have no will of my own,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and very hard to
      press in this way when you know I am in trouble.&rdquo; The inevitable
      handkerchief appeared, adding emphasis to the protest&mdash;and the
      becoming tears showed themselves modestly in Regina&rsquo;s magnificent eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius started out of his chair, and walked away to the window. That last
      reference to Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s pecuniary cares was more than he had patience
      to endure. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t even forget her uncle and his bank,&rdquo; he thought,
      &ldquo;when I am speaking to her of our marriage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kept his face hidden from her, at the window. By some subtle process of
      association which he was unable to trace, the image of Simple Sally rose
      in his mind. An irresistible influence forced him to think of her&mdash;not
      as the poor, starved, degraded, half-witted creature of the streets, but
      as the grateful girl who had asked for no happier future than to be his
      servant, who had dropped senseless at his feet at the bare prospect of
      parting with him. His sense of self-respect, his loyalty to his betrothed
      wife, resolutely resisted the unworthy conclusion to which his own
      thoughts were leading him. He turned back again to Regina; he spoke so
      loudly and so vehemently that the gathering flow of her tears was
      suspended in surprise. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re quite right, my dear! I ought
      to give you time, of course. I try to control my hasty temper, but I don&rsquo;t
      always succeed&mdash;just at first. Pray forgive me; it shall be exactly
      as you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina forgave him, with a gentle and ladylike astonishment at the
      excitable manner in which he made his excuses. She even neglected her
      embroidery, and put her face up to him to be kissed. &ldquo;You are so nice,
      dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when you are not violent and unreasonable. It is such a
      pity you were brought up in America. Won&rsquo;t you stay to lunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happily for Amelius, the footman appeared at this critical moment with a
      message: &ldquo;My mistress wishes particularly to see you, sir, before you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the first occasion, in the experience of the lovers, on which
      Mrs. Farnaby had expressed her wishes through the medium of a servant,
      instead of appearing personally. The curiosity of Regina was mildly
      excited. &ldquo;What a very odd message!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;what does it mean? My aunt
      went out earlier than usual this morning, and I have not seen her since. I
      wonder whether she is going to consult you about my uncle&rsquo;s affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see,&rdquo; said Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And stay to lunch?&rdquo; Regina reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-day, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to-morrow.&rdquo; So he escaped. As he opened the door, he looked back,
      and kissed his hand. Regina raised her head for a moment, and smiled
      charmingly. She was hard at work again over her embroidery.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      The door of Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s ground-floor room, at the back of the house,
      was partially open. She was on the watch for Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; she cried, the moment he appeared in the hall. She pulled him
      into the room, and shut the door with a bang. Her face was flushed, her
      eyes were wild. &ldquo;I have something to tell you, you dear good fellow,&rdquo; she
      burst out excitedly&mdash;&ldquo;Something in confidence, between you and me!&rdquo;
       She paused, and looked at him with sudden anxiety and alarm. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      matter with you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the room, the reference to a secret, the prospect of another
      private conference, forced back the mind of Amelius, in one breathless
      instant, to his first memorable interview with Mrs. Farnaby. The mother&rsquo;s
      piteously hopeful words, in speaking of her lost daughter, rang in his
      ears again as if they had just fallen from her lips. &ldquo;She may be lost in
      the labyrinth of London.... To-morrow, or ten years hence, you <i>might</i>
      meet with her.&rdquo; There were a hundred chances against it&mdash;a thousand,
      ten thousand chances against it. The startling possibility flashed across
      his brain, nevertheless, like a sudden flow of daylight across the dark.
      <i>&ldquo;Have</i> I met with her, at the first chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I have something to say before you speak to me. Don&rsquo;t
      deceive yourself with vain hopes. Promise me that, before I begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waved her hand derisively. &ldquo;Hopes?&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;I have done with
      hopes, I have done with fears&mdash;I have got to certainties, at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was too eager to heed anything that she said to him; his whole soul was
      absorbed in the coming disclosure. &ldquo;Two nights since,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I was
      wandering about London, and I met&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst out laughing. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; she cried, with a wild derisive gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius stopped, perplexed and startled. &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I defy you to surprise me. Out with it! Whom did
      you meet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius proceeded doubtfully, by a word at a time. &ldquo;I met a poor girl in
      the streets,&rdquo; he said, steadily watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She changed completely at those words; she looked at him with an aspect of
      stern reproach. &ldquo;No more of it,&rdquo; she interposed; &ldquo;I have not waited all
      these miserable years for such a horrible end as that.&rdquo; Her face suddenly
      brightened; a radiant effusion of tenderness and triumph flowed over it,
      and made it young and happy again. &ldquo;Amelius!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;listen to this.
      My dream has come true&mdash;my girl is found! Thanks to you, though you
      don&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked at her. Was she speaking of something that had really
      happened? or had she been dreaming again?
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in her own happiness, she made no remark on his silence. &ldquo;I have
      seen the woman,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;This bright blessed morning I have seen the
      woman who took her away in the first days of her poor little life. The
      wretch swears she was not to blame. I tried to forgive her. Perhaps I
      almost did forgive her, in the joy of hearing what she had to tell me. I
      should never have heard it, Amelius, if you had not given that glorious
      lecture. The woman was one of your audience. She would never have spoken
      of those past days; she would never have thought of me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At those words, Mrs. Farnaby abruptly stopped, and turned her face away
      from Amelius. After waiting a little, finding her still silent, still
      immovable, he ventured on putting a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you are not deceived?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I remember you told me
      that rogues had tried to impose on you, in past times when you employed
      people to find her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have proof that I am not being imposed upon,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby answered,
      still keeping her face hidden from him. &ldquo;One of them knows of the fault in
      her foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them?&rdquo; Amelius repeated. &ldquo;How many of them are there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two. The old woman, and a young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are their names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t tell me their names yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a little suspicious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them knows,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby reiterated, &ldquo;of the fault in her foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask which of them knows? The old woman, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange, isn&rsquo;t it? Have you seen the young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of him, except the little that the woman told me. He has
      written me a letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I look at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t let you look at it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius said no more. If he had felt the smallest suspicion that the
      disclosure volunteered by Mrs. Farnaby, at their first interview, had been
      overheard by the unknown person who had opened the swinging window in the
      kitchen, he might have recalled Phoebe&rsquo;s vindictive language at his
      lodgings, and the doubts suggested to him by his discovery of the vagabond
      waiting for her in the street. As it was, he was simply puzzled. The one
      plain conclusion to his mind was, unhappily, the natural conclusion after
      what he had heard&mdash;that Mrs. Farnaby had no sort of interest in the
      discovery of Simple Sally, and that he need trouble himself with no
      further anxiety in that matter. Strange as Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s mysterious
      revelation seemed, her correspondent&rsquo;s knowledge of the fault in the foot
      was circumstance in his favour, beyond dispute. Amelius still wondered
      inwardly how it was that the woman who had taken charge of the child had
      failed to discover what appeared to be known to another person. If he had
      been aware that Mrs. Sowler&rsquo;s occupation at the time was the occupation of
      a &ldquo;baby-farmer,&rdquo; and that she had many other deserted children pining
      under her charge, he might have easily understood that she was the last
      person in the world to trouble herself with a minute examination of any
      one of the unfortunate little creatures abandoned to her drunken and
      merciless neglect. Jervy had satisfied himself, before he trusted her with
      his instructions, that she knew no more than the veriest stranger of any
      peculiarity in one or the other of the child&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interpreting Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s last reply to him as an intimation that their
      interview was at an end, Amelius took up his hat to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope with all my heart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that what has begun so well will end
      well. If there is any service that I can do for you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew nearer to him, and put her hand gently on his shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      think that I distrust you,&rdquo; she said very earnestly; &ldquo;I am unwilling to
      shock you&mdash;that is all. Even this great joy has a dark side to it; my
      miserable married life casts its shadow on everything that happens to me.
      Keep secret from everybody the little that I have told you&mdash;you will
      ruin me if you say one word of it to any living creature. I ought not to
      have opened my heart to you&mdash;but how could I help it, when the
      happiness that is coming to me has come through you? When you say good-bye
      to me to-day, Amelius, you say good-bye to me for the last time in this
      house. I am going away. Don&rsquo;t ask me why&mdash;that is one more among the
      things which I daren&rsquo;t tell you! You shall hear from me, or see me&mdash;I
      promise that. Give me some safe address to write to; some place where
      there are no inquisitive women who may open my letter in your absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She handed him her pocket-book. Amelius wrote down in it the address of
      his club.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took his hand. &ldquo;Think of me kindly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And, once more, don&rsquo;t
      be afraid of my being deceived. There is a hard part of me still left
      which keeps me on my guard. The old woman tried, this morning, to make me
      talk to her about that little fault we know of in my child&rsquo;s foot. But I
      thought to myself, &lsquo;If you had taken a proper interest in my poor baby
      while she was with you, you must sooner or later have found it out.&rsquo; Not a
      word passed my lips. No, no, don&rsquo;t be anxious when you think of me. I am
      as sharp as they are; I mean to find out how the man who wrote to me
      discovered what he knows; he shall satisfy me, I promise you, when I see
      him or hear from him next. All this is between ourselves strictly,
      sacredly between ourselves. Say nothing&mdash;I know I can trust you.
      Good-bye, and forgive me for having been so often in your way with Regina.
      I shall never be in your way again. Marry her, if you think she is good
      enough for you; I have no more interest now in your being a roving
      bachelor, meeting with girls here, there, and everywhere. You shall know
      how it goes on. Oh, I am so happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She burst into tears, and signed to Amelius with a wild gesture of treaty
      to leave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand in silence, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as the door closed on him, the variable woman changed again. For a
      while she walked rapidly to and fro, talking to herself. The course of her
      tears ceased. Her lips closed firmly; her eyes assumed an expression of
      savage resolve. She sat down at the table and opened her desk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read
      it once more,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;before I seal it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took from her desk a letter of her own writing, and spread it out
      before her. With her elbows on the table, and her hands clasped fiercely
      in her hair, she read these lines addressed to her husband:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHN FARNABY,&mdash;I have always suspected that you had something to do
      with the disappearance of our child. I know for certain now that you
      deliberately cast your infant daughter on the mercy of the world, and
      condemned your wife to a life of wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose that I have been deceived! I have spoken with the woman who
      waited by the garden-paling at Ramsgate, and who took the child from your
      hands. She saw you with me at the lecture; and she is absolutely sure that
      you are the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to the meeting at the lecture-hall, I am at last on the trace of
      my lost daughter. This morning I heard the woman&rsquo;s story. She kept the
      child, on the chance of its being reclaimed, until she could afford to
      keep it no longer. She met with a person who was willing to adopt it, and
      who took it away with her to a foreign country, not mentioned to me yet.
      In that country my daughter is still living, and will be restored to me on
      conditions which will be communicated in a few days&rsquo; time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of this story may be true, and some of it may be false; the woman
      may be lying to serve her own interests with me. Of one thing I am sure&mdash;my
      girl is identified, by means known to me of which there can be no doubt.
      And she must be still living, because the interest of the persons treating
      with me is an interest in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you receive this letter, on your return from business to-night, I
      shall have left you, and left you for ever. The bare thought of even
      looking at you again fills me with horror. I have my own income, and I
      mean to take my own way. In your best interests I warn you, make no
      attempt to trace me. I declare solemnly that, rather than let your
      deserted daughter be polluted by the sight of you, I would kill you with
      my own hand, and die for it on the scaffold. If she ever asks for her
      father, I will do you one service. For the honour of human nature, I will
      tell her that her father is dead. It will not be all a falsehood. I
      repudiate you and your name&mdash;you are dead to me from this time forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sign myself by my father&rsquo;s name&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EMMA RONALD.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had said herself that she was unwilling to shock Amelius. This was the
      reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      After thinking a little, she sealed and directed the letter. This done,
      she unlocked the wooden press which had once contained the baby&rsquo;s frock
      and cap, and those other memorials of the past which she called her &ldquo;dead
      consolations.&rdquo; After satisfying herself that the press was empty, she
      wrote on a card, &ldquo;To be called for by a messenger from my bankers&rdquo;&mdash;and
      tied the card to a tin box in a corner, secured by a padlock. She lifted
      the box, and placed it in front of the press, so that it might be easily
      visible to any one entering the room. The safe keeping of her treasures
      provided for, she took the sealed letter, and, ascending the stairs,
      placed it on the table in her husband&rsquo;s dressing-room. She hurried out
      again, the instant after, as if the sight of the place were intolerable to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing to the other end of the corridor, she entered her own bedchamber,
      and put on her bonnet and cloak. A leather handbag was on the bed. She
      took it up, and looked round the large luxurious room with a shudder of
      disgust. What she had suffered, within those four walls, no human creature
      knew but herself. She hurried out, as she had hurried out of her husband&rsquo;s
      dressing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her niece was still in the drawing-room. As she reached the door, she
      hesitated, and stopped. The girl was a good girl, in her own dull placid
      way&mdash;and her sister&rsquo;s daughter, too. A last little act of kindness
      would perhaps be a welcome act to remember. She opened the door so
      suddenly that Regina started, with a small cry of alarm. &ldquo;Oh, aunt, how
      you frighten one! Are you going out?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m going out,&rdquo; was the short
      answer. &ldquo;Come here. Give me a kiss.&rdquo; Regina looked up in wide-eyed
      astonishment. Mrs. Farnaby stamped impatiently on the floor. Regina rose,
      gracefully bewildered. &ldquo;My dear aunt, how very odd!&rdquo; she said&mdash;and
      gave the kiss demanded, with a serenely surprised elevation of her finely
      shaped eyebrows. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farnaby; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it&mdash;one of my
      oddities. Go back to your work. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left the room, as abruptly as she had entered it. With her firm heavy
      step she descended to the hall, passed out at the house door, and closed
      it behind her&mdash;never to return to it again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      Amelius left Mrs. Farnaby, troubled by emotions of confusion and alarm,
      which he was the last man living to endure patiently. Her extraordinary
      story of the discovered daughter, the still more startling assertion of
      her solution to leave the house, the absence of any plain explanation, the
      burden of secrecy imposed on him&mdash;all combined together to irritate
      his sensitive nerves. &ldquo;I hate mysteries,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;and ever since I
      landed in England, I seem fated to be mixed up in them. Does she really
      mean to leave her husband and her niece? What will Farnaby do? What will
      become of Regina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To think of Regina was to think of the new repulse of which he had been
      made the subject. Again he had appealed to her love for him, and again she
      had refused to marry him at his own time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was especially perplexed and angry, when he reflected on the
      unassailably strong influence which her uncle appeared to have over her.
      All Regina&rsquo;s sympathy was with Mr. Farnaby and his troubles. Amelius might
      have understood her a little better, if she had told him what had passed
      between her uncle and herself on the night of Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s return, in a
      state of indignation, from the lecture. In terror of the engagement being
      broken off, she had been forced to confess that she was too fond of
      Amelius to prevail on herself to part with him. If he attempted a second
      exposition of his Socialist principles on the platform, she owned that it
      might be impossible to receive him again as a suitor. But she pleaded hard
      for the granting of a pardon to the first offence, in the interests of her
      own tranquillity, if not in mercy to Amelius. Mr. Farnaby, already
      troubled by his commercial anxieties, had listened more amiably, and also
      more absently, than usual; and had granted her petition with the ready
      indulgence of a preoccupied man. It had been decided between them that the
      offence of the lecture should be passed over in discreet silence. Regina&rsquo;s
      gratitude for this concession inspired her sympathy with her uncle in his
      present state of suspense. She had been sorely tempted to tell Amelius
      what had happened. But the natural reserve of her character&mdash;fortified,
      in this instance, by the defensive pride which makes a woman unwilling,
      before marriage, to confess her weakness unreservedly to the man who has
      caused it&mdash;had sealed her lips. &ldquo;When he is a little less violent and
      a little more humble,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;perhaps I may tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it fell out that Amelius took his way through the streets, a mystified
      and an angry man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in sight of the hotel, he stopped, and looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to disguise from himself that a lurking sense of regret
      was making itself felt, in his present frame of mind, when he thought of
      Simple Sally. In all probability, he would have quarrelled with any man
      who had accused him of actually lamenting the girl&rsquo;s absence, and wanting
      her back again. He happened to recollect her artless blue eyes, with their
      vague patient look, and her quaint childish questions put so openly in so
      sweet a voice&mdash;and that was all. Was there anything reprehensible, if
      you please, in an act of remembrance? Comforting himself with these
      considerations, he moved on again a step or two&mdash;and stopped once
      more. In his present humour, he shrank from facing Rufus. The American
      read him like a book; the American would ask irritating questions. He
      turned his back on the hotel, and looked at his watch. As he took it out,
      his finger and thumb touched something else in his waistcoat-pocket. It
      was the card that Regina had given to him&mdash;the card of the cottage to
      let. He had nothing to do, and nowhere to go. Why not look at the cottage?
      If it proved to be not worth seeing, the Zoological Gardens were in the
      neighbourhood&mdash;and there are periods in a man&rsquo;s life when he finds
      the society that walks on four feet a welcome relief from the society that
      walks on two.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fairly fine day. He turned northward towards the Regent&rsquo;s Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cottage was in a by-road, just outside the park: a cottage in the
      strictest sense of the word. A sitting-room, a library, and a bedroom&mdash;all
      of small proportions&mdash;and, under them a kitchen and two more rooms,
      represented the whole of the little dwelling from top to bottom. It was
      simply and prettily furnished; and it was completely surrounded by its own
      tiny plot of garden-ground. The library especially was a perfect little
      retreat, looking out on the back garden; peaceful and shady, and adorned
      with bookcases of old carved oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius had hardly looked round the room, before his inflammable brain was
      on fire with a new idea. Other idle men in trouble had found the solace
      and the occupation of their lives in books. Why should he not be one of
      them? Why not plunge into study in this delightful retirement&mdash;and
      perhaps, one day, astonish Regina and Mr. Farnaby by bursting on the world
      as the writer of a famous book? Exactly as Amelius, two days since, had
      seen himself in the future, a public lecturer in receipt of glorious fees&mdash;so
      he now saw himself the celebrated scholar and writer of a new era to come.
      The woman who showed the cottage happened to mention that a gentleman had
      already looked over it that morning, and had seemed to like it. Amelius
      instantly gave her a shilling, and said, &ldquo;I take it on the spot.&rdquo; The
      wondering woman referred him to the house-agent&rsquo;s address, and kept at a
      safe distance from the excitable stranger as she let him out. In less than
      another hour, Amelius had taken the cottage, and had returned to the hotel
      with a new interest in life and a new surprise for Rufus.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, in cases of emergency, the American wasted no time in talking.
      He went out at once to see the cottage, and to make his own inquiries of
      the agent. The result amply proved that Amelius had not been imposed upon.
      If he repented of his bargain, the gentleman who had first seen the
      cottage was ready to take it off his hands, at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back to the Hotel, Rufus found Amelius resolute to move into his new
      abode, and eager for the coming life of study and retirement. Knowing
      perfectly well before-hand how this latter project would end, the American
      tried the efficacy of a little worldly temptation. He had arranged, he
      said, &ldquo;to have a good time of it in Paris&rdquo;; and he proposed that Amelius
      should be his companion. The suggestion produced not the slightest effect;
      Amelius talked as if he was a confirmed recluse, in the decline of life.
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, with the most amazing gravity; &ldquo;I prefer the company
      of my books, and the seclusion of my study.&rdquo; This declaration was followed
      by more selling-out of money in the Funds, and by a visit to a bookseller,
      which left a handsome pecuniary result inscribed on the right side of the
      ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day, Amelius presented himself towards two o&rsquo;clock at Mr.
      Farnaby&rsquo;s house. He was not so selfishly absorbed in his own projects as
      to forget Mrs. Farnaby. On the contrary, he was honestly anxious for news
      of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain middle-aged man of business has been briefly referred to, in
      these pages, as one of Regina&rsquo;s faithful admirers, patiently submitting to
      the triumph of his favoured young rival. This gentleman, issuing from his
      carriage with his card-case ready in his hand, met Amelius at the door,
      with a face which announced plainly that a catastrophe had happened. &ldquo;You
      have heard the sad news, no doubt?&rdquo; he said, in a rich bass voice attuned
      to sadly courteous tones. The servant opened the door before Amelius could
      answer. After a contest of politeness, the middle-aged gentleman consented
      to make his inquiries first. &ldquo;How is Mr. Farnaby? No better? And Miss
      Regina? Very poorly, oh? Dear, dear me! Say I called, if you please.&rdquo; He
      handed in two cards, with a severe enjoyment of the melancholy occasion
      and the rich bass sounds of his own voice. &ldquo;Very sad, is it not?&rdquo; he said,
      addressing his youthful rival with an air of paternal indulgence. &ldquo;Good
      morning.&rdquo; He bowed with melancholy grace, and got into his carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked after the prosperous merchant, as the prancing horses drew
      him away. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he thought bitterly, &ldquo;she might be happier with
      that rich prig than she could be with me.&rdquo; He stepped into the hall, and
      spoke to the servant. The man had his message ready. Miss Regina would see
      Mr. Goldenheart, if he would be so good as to wait in the dinning-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina appeared, pale and scared; her eyes inflamed with weeping. &ldquo;Oh,
      Amelius, can you tell me what this dreadful misfortune means? Why has she
      left us? When she sent for you yesterday, what did she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his position, Amelius could make but one answer. &ldquo;Your aunt said she
      thought of going away. But,&rdquo; he added, with perfect truth, &ldquo;she refused to
      tell me why, or where she was going. I am quite as much at a loss to
      understand her as you are. What does your uncle propose to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s conduct, as described by Regina, thickened the mystery&mdash;he
      proposed to do nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been found on the hearth-rug in his dressing-room; having
      apparently been seized with a fit, in the act of burning some paper. The
      ashes were discovered close by him, just inside the fender. On his
      recovery, his first anxiety was to know if a letter had been burnt.
      Satisfied on this point, he had ordered the servants to assemble round his
      bed, and had peremptorily forbidden them to open the door to their
      mistress, if she ever returned at any future time to the house. Regina&rsquo;s
      questions and remonstrances, when she was left alone with him, were
      answered, once for all, in these pitiless terms:&mdash;&ldquo;If you wish to
      deserve the fatherly interest that I take in you, do as I do: forget that
      such a person as your aunt ever existed. We shall quarrel, if you ever
      mention her name in my hearing again.&rdquo; This said, he had instantly changed
      the subject; instructing Regina to write an excuse to &ldquo;Mr. Melton&rdquo;
       (otherwise, the middle-aged rival), with whom he had been engaged to dine
      that evening. Relating this latter event, Regina&rsquo;s ever-ready gratitude
      overflowed in the direction of Mr. Melton. &ldquo;He was so kind! he left his
      guests in the evening, and came and sat with my uncle for nearly an hour.&rdquo;
       Amelius made no remark on this; he led the conversation back to the
      subject of Mrs. Farnaby. &ldquo;She once spoke to me of her lawyers,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Do <i>they</i> know nothing about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer to this question showed that the sternly final decision of Mr.
      Farnaby was matched by equal resolution on the part of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the partners in the legal firm had called that morning, to see
      Regina on a matter of business. Mrs. Farnaby had appeared at the office on
      the previous day, and had briefly expressed her wish to make a small
      annual provision for her niece, in case of future need. Declining to enter
      into any explanation, she had waited until the necessary document had been
      drawn out; had requested that Regina might be informed of the
      circumstance; and had then taken her departure in absolute silence.
      Hearing that she had left her husband, the lawyer, like every one else,
      was completely at a loss to understand what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does the doctor say?&rdquo; Amelius asked next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle is to be kept perfectly quiet,&rdquo; Regina answered; &ldquo;and is not to
      return to business for some time to come. Mr. Melton, with his usual
      kindness, has undertaken to look after his affairs for him. Otherwise, my
      uncle, in his present state of anxiety about the bank, would never have
      consented to obey the doctor&rsquo;s orders. When he can safely travel, he is
      recommended to go abroad for the winter, and get well again in some warmer
      climate. He refuses to leave his business&mdash;and the doctor refuses to
      take the responsibility. There is to be a consultation of physicians
      tomorrow. Oh, Amelius, I was really fond of my aunt&mdash;I am
      heart-broken at this dreadful change!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a momentary silence. If Mr. Melton had been present, he would
      have said a few neatly sympathetic words. Amelius knew no more than a
      savage of the art of conventional consolation. Tadmor had made him
      familiar with the social and political questions of the time, and had
      taught him to speak in public. But Tadmor, rich in books and newspapers,
      was a powerless training institution in the matter of small talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose Mr. Farnaby is obliged to go abroad,&rdquo; he suggested, after waiting
      a little, &ldquo;what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina looked at him, with an air of melancholy surprise. &ldquo;I shall do my
      duty, of course,&rdquo; she answered gravely. &ldquo;I shall accompany my dear uncle,
      if he wishes it.&rdquo; She glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece. &ldquo;It is time
      he took his medicine,&rdquo; she resumed; &ldquo;you will excuse me, I am sure.&rdquo; She
      shook hands, not very warmly&mdash;and hastened out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius left the house, with a conviction which disheartened him&mdash;the
      conviction that he had never understood Regina, and that he was not likely
      to understand her in the future. He turned for relief to the consideration
      of Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s strange conduct, under the domestic disaster which had
      befallen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recalling what he had observed for himself, and what he had heard from
      Mrs. Farnaby when she had first taken him into her confidence, he inferred
      that the subject of the lost child had not only been a subject of
      estrangement between the husband and wife, but that the husband was, in
      some way, the person blamable for it. Assuming this theory to be the right
      one, there would be serious obstacles to the meeting of the mother and
      child, in the mother&rsquo;s home. The departure of Mrs. Farnaby was, in that
      case, no longer unintelligible&mdash;and Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s otherwise
      inexplicable conduct had the light of a motive thrown on it, which might
      not unnaturally influence a hard-hearted man weary alike of his wife and
      his wife&rsquo;s troubles. Arriving at this conclusion by a far shorter process
      than is here indicated, Amelius pursued the subject no further. At the
      time when he had first visited the Farnabys, Rufus had advised him to
      withdraw from closer intercourse with them, while he had the chance. In
      his present mood, he was almost in danger of acknowledging to himself that
      Rufus had proved to be right.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lunched with his American friend at the hotel. Before the meal was over
      Mrs. Payson called, to say a few cheering words about Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not to be denied that the girl remained persistently silent and
      reserved. In other respects the report was highly favourable. She was
      obedient to the rules of the house; she was always ready with any little
      services that she could render to her companions; and she was so eager to
      improve herself, by means of her reading-lessons and writing-lessons, that
      it was not easy to induce her to lay aside her book and her slate. When
      the teacher offered her some small reward for her good conduct, and asked
      what she would like, the sad little face brightened, and the faithful
      creature&rsquo;s answer was always the same&mdash;&ldquo;I should like to know what he
      is doing now.&rdquo; (Alas for Sally!&mdash;&ldquo;he&rdquo; meant Amelius.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must wait a little longer before you write to her,&rdquo; Mrs. Payson
      concluded, &ldquo;and you must not think of seeing her for some time to come. I
      know you will help us by consenting to this&mdash;for Sally&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius bowed in silence. He would not have confessed what he felt, at
      that moment, to any living soul&mdash;it is doubtful if he even confessed
      it to himself. Mrs. Payson, observing him with a woman&rsquo;s keen sympathy,
      relented a little. &ldquo;I might give her a message,&rdquo; the good lady suggested&mdash;&ldquo;just
      to say you are glad to hear she is behaving so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give her this?&rdquo; Amelius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took from his pocket a little photograph of the cottage, which he had
      noticed on the house-agent&rsquo;s desk, and had taken away with him. &ldquo;It is <i>my</i>
      cottage now,&rdquo; he explained, in tones that faltered a little; &ldquo;I am going
      to live there; Sally might like to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally <i>shall</i> see it,&rdquo; Mrs. Payson agreed&mdash;&ldquo;if you will only
      let me take this away first.&rdquo; She pointed to the address of the cottage,
      printed under the photograph. Past experience in the Home made her
      reluctant to trust Sally with the address in London at which Amelius was
      to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus produced a huge complex knife, out of the depths of which a pair of
      scissors burst on touching a spring. Mrs. Payson cut off the address, and
      placed the photograph in her pocket-book. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Sally will be
      happy, and no harm can come of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known you, ma&rsquo;am, nigh on twenty years,&rdquo; Rufus remarked. &ldquo;I do
      assure you that&rsquo;s the first rash observation I ever heard from your lips.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Two days later, Amelius moved into his cottage.
    </h3>
    <p>
      He had provided himself with a new servant, as easily as he had provided
      himself with a new abode. A foreign waiter at the hotel&mdash;a
      gray-haired Frenchman of the old school, reputed to be the most
      ill-tempered servant in the house&mdash;had felt the genial influence of
      Amelius with the receptive readiness of his race. Here was a young
      Englishman, who spoke to him as easily and pleasantly as if he was
      speaking to a friend&mdash;who heard him relate his little grievances, and
      never took advantage of that circumstance to turn him into ridicule&mdash;who
      said kindly, &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind my calling you by your nickname,&rdquo; when
      he ventured to explain that his Christian name was &ldquo;Theophile,&rdquo; and that
      his English fellow servants had facetiously altered and shortened it to
      &ldquo;Toff,&rdquo; to suit their insular convenience. &ldquo;For the first time, sir,&rdquo; he
      had hastened to add, &ldquo;I feel it an honour to be Toff, when <i>you</i>
      speak to me.&rdquo; Asking everybody whom he met if they could recommend a
      servant to him, Amelius had put the question, when Toff came in one
      morning with the hot water. The old Frenchman made a low bow, expressive
      of devotion. &ldquo;I know of but one man, sir, whom I can safely recommend,&rdquo; he
      answered&mdash;&ldquo;take me.&rdquo; Amelius was delighted; he had only one objection
      to make. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to keep two servants,&rdquo; he said, while Toff was
      helping him on with his dressing-gown. &ldquo;Why should you keep two servants,
      sir?&rdquo; the Frenchman inquired. Amelius answered, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask you to make
      the beds.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Toff&mdash;and made the bed, then and there, in
      five minutes. He ran out of the room, and came back with one of the
      chambermaid&rsquo;s brooms. &ldquo;Judge for yourself, sir&mdash;can I sweep a
      carpet?&rdquo; He placed a chair for Amelius. &ldquo;Permit me to save you the trouble
      of shaving yourself. Are you satisfied? Very good. I am equally capable of
      cutting your hair, and attending to your corns (if you suffer, sir, from
      that inconvenience). Will you allow me to propose something which you have
      not had yet for your breakfast?&rdquo; In half an hour more, he brought in the
      new dish. &ldquo;Oeufs a la Tripe. An elementary specimen, sir, of what I can do
      for you as a cook. Be pleased to taste it.&rdquo; Amelius ate it all up on the
      spot; and Toff applied the moral, with the neatest choice of language.
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, for a gratifying expression of approval. One more
      specimen of my poor capabilities, and I have done. It is barely possible&mdash;God
      forbid!&mdash;that you may fall ill. Honour me by reading that document.&rdquo;
       He handed a written paper to Amelius, dated some years since in Paris, and
      signed in an English name. &ldquo;I testify with gratitude and pleasure that
      Theophile Leblond has nursed me through a long illness, with an
      intelligence and devotion which I cannot too highly praise.&rdquo; &ldquo;May you
      never employ me, sir, in that capacity,&rdquo; said Toff. &ldquo;I have only to add
      that I am not so old as I look, and that my political opinions have
      changed, in later life, from red-republican to moderate-liberal. I also
      confess, if necessary, that I still have an ardent admiration for the fair
      sex.&rdquo; He laid his hand on his heart, and waited to be engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the household at the cottage was modestly limited to Amelius and Toff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus remained for another week in London, to watch the new experiment. He
      had made careful inquiries into the Frenchman&rsquo;s character, and had found
      that the complaints of his temper really amounted to this&mdash;that &ldquo;he
      gave himself the airs of a gentleman, and didn&rsquo;t understand a joke.&rdquo; On
      the question of honesty and sobriety, the testimony of the proprietor of
      the hotel left Rufus nothing to desire. Greatly to his surprise, Amelius
      showed no disposition to grow weary of his quiet life, or to take refuge
      in perilous amusements from the sober society of his books. He was regular
      in his inquiries at Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s house; he took long walks by himself; he
      never mentioned Sally&rsquo;s name; he lost his interest in going to the
      theatre, and he never appeared in the smoking-room of the club. Some men,
      observing the remarkable change which had passed over his excitable
      temperament, would have hailed it as a good sign for the future. The New
      Englander looked below the surface, and was not so easily deceived. &ldquo;My
      bright boy&rsquo;s soul is discouraged and cast down,&rdquo; was the conclusion that
      he drew. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s darkness in him where there once was light; and, what&rsquo;s
      worse than all, he caves in, and keeps it to himself.&rdquo; After vainly trying
      to induce Amelius to open his heart, Rufus at last went to Paris, with a
      mind that was ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of the American&rsquo;s departure, the march of events was resumed;
      and the unnaturally quiet life of Amelius began to be disturbed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making his customary inquiries in the forenoon at Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s door, he
      found the household in a state of agitation. A second council of
      physicians had been held, in consequence of the appearance of some
      alarming symptoms in the case of the patient. On this occasion, the
      medical men told him plainly that he would sacrifice his life to his
      obstinacy, if he persisted in remaining in London and returning to his
      business. By good fortune, the affairs of the bank had greatly benefited,
      through the powerful interposition of Mr. Melton. With the improved
      prospects, Mr. Farnaby (at his niece&rsquo;s entreaty) submitted to the doctor&rsquo;s
      advice. He was to start on the first stage of his journey the next
      morning; and, at his own earnest desire, Regina was to go with him. &ldquo;I
      hate strangers and foreigners; and I don&rsquo;t like being alone. If you don&rsquo;t
      go with me, I shall stay where I am&mdash;and die.&rdquo; So Mr. Farnaby put it
      to his adopted daughter, in his rasping voice and with his hard frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grieved, dear Amelius, to go away from you,&rdquo; Regina said; &ldquo;but what
      can I do? It would have been so nice if you could have gone with us. I did
      hint something of the sort; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her downcast face finished the sentence. Amelius felt the bare idea of
      being Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s travelling companion make his blood run cold. And Mr.
      Farnaby, on his side, reciprocated the sentiment. &ldquo;I will write
      constantly, dear,&rdquo; Regina resumed; &ldquo;and you will write back, won&rsquo;t you?
      Say you love me; and promise to come tomorrow morning, before we go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him affectionately&mdash;and, the instant after, checked the
      responsive outburst of tenderness in Amelius, by that utter want of tact
      which (in spite of the popular delusion to the contrary) is so much more
      common in women than in men, &ldquo;My uncle is so particular about packing his
      linen,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;nobody can please him but me; I must ask you to let me
      run upstairs again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius went out into the street, with his head down and his lips fast
      closed. He was not far from Mrs. Payson&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I call?&rdquo;
       he thought to himself. His conscience added, &ldquo;And hear some news of
      Sally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was good news. The girl was brightening mentally and physically&mdash;she
      was in a fair way, if she only remained in the Home, to be &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; Sally
      no longer. Amelius asked if she had got the photograph of the cottage.
      Mrs. Payson laughed. &ldquo;Sleeps with it under her pillow, poor child,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;and looks at it fifty times a day.&rdquo; Thirty years since, with
      infinitely less experience to guide her, the worthy matron would have
      followed her instincts, and would have hesitated to tell Amelius quite so
      much about the photograph. But some of a woman&rsquo;s finer sensibilities do
      get blunted with the advance of age and the accumulation of wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of pursuing the subject of Sally&rsquo;s progress, Amelius, to Mrs.
      Payson&rsquo;s surprise, made a clumsy excuse, and abruptly took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt the need of being alone; he was conscious of a vague distrust of
      himself, which degraded him in his own estimation. Was he, like characters
      he had read of in books, the victim of a fatality? The slightest
      circumstances conspired to heighten his interest in Sally&mdash;just at
      the time when Regina had once more disappointed him. He was as firmly
      convinced, as if he had been the strictest moralist living, that it was an
      insult to Regina, and an insult to his own self-respect, to set the lost
      creature whom he had rescued in any light of comparison with the young
      lady who was one day to be his wife. And yet, try as he might to drive her
      out, Sally kept her place in his thoughts. There was, apparently, some
      innate depravity in him. If a looking-glass had been handed to him at that
      moment, he would have been ashamed to look himself in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking until he was weary, he went to his club.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter gave him a letter as he crossed the hall. Mrs. Farnaby had kept
      her promise, and had written to him. The smoking-room was deserted at that
      time of day. He opened his letter in solitude, looked at it, crumpled it
      up impatiently, and put it into his pocket. Not even Mrs. Farnaby could
      interest him at that critical moment. His own affairs absorbed him. The
      one idea in his mind, after what he had heard about Sally, was the idea of
      making a last effort to hasten the date of his marriage before Mr. Farnaby
      left England. &ldquo;If I can only feel sure of Regina&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts went no further than that. He walked up and down the empty
      smoking-room, anxious and irritable, dissatisfied with himself, despairing
      of the future. &ldquo;I can but try it!&rdquo; he suddenly decided&mdash;and turned at
      once to the table to write a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death had been busy with the members of his family in the long interval
      that had passed since he and his father left England. His nearest
      surviving relative was his uncle&mdash;his father&rsquo;s younger brother&mdash;who
      occupied a post of high importance in the Foreign Office. To this
      gentleman he now wrote, announcing his arrival in England, and his anxiety
      to qualify himself for employment in a Government office. &ldquo;Be so good as
      to grant me an interview,&rdquo; he concluded; &ldquo;and I hope to satisfy you that I
      am not unworthy of your kindness, if you will exert your influence in my
      favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sent away his letter at once by a private messenger, with instructions
      to wait for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not without doubt, and even pain, that he had opened communication
      with a man whose harsh treatment of his father it was impossible for him
      to forget. What could the son expect? There was but one hope. Time might
      have inclined the younger brother to make atonement to the memory of the
      elder, by a favourable reception of his nephew&rsquo;s request.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father&rsquo;s last words of caution, his own boyish promise not to claim
      kindred with his relations in England, were vividly present to the mind of
      Amelius, while he waited for the return of the messenger. His one
      justification was in the motives that animated him. Circumstances, which
      his father had never anticipated, rendered it an act of duty towards
      himself to make the trial at least of what his family interest could do
      for him. There could be no sort of doubt that a man of Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s
      character would yield, if Amelius could announce that he had the promise
      of an appointment under Government&mdash;with the powerful influence of a
      near relation to accelerate his promotion. He sat, idly drawing lines on
      the blotting-paper; at one moment regretting that he had sent his letter;
      at another, comforting himself in the belief that, if his father had been
      living to advise him, his father would have approved of the course that he
      had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger returned with these lines of reply:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under any ordinary circumstances, I should have used my influence to help
      you on in the world. But, when you not only hold the most abominable
      political opinions, but actually proclaim those opinions in public, I am
      amazed at your audacity in writing to me. There must be no more
      communication between us. While you are a Socialist, you are a stranger to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius accepted this new rebuff with ominous composure. He sat quietly
      smoking in the deserted room, with his uncle&rsquo;s letter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the other disastrous results of the lecture, some of the newspapers
      had briefly reported it. Preoccupied by his anxieties, Amelius had
      forgotten this when he wrote to his relative. &ldquo;Just like me!&rdquo; he thought,
      as he threw the letter into the fire. His last hopes floated up the
      chimney, with the tiny puff of smoke from the burnt paper. There was now
      no other chance of shortening the marriage engagement left to try. He had
      already applied to the good friend whom he had mentioned to Regina. The
      answer, kindly written in this case, had not been very encouraging:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have other claims to consider. All that I can do, I will do. Don&rsquo;t be
      disheartened&mdash;I only ask you to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius rose to go home&mdash;and sat down again. His natural energy
      seemed to have deserted him&mdash;it required an effort to leave the club.
      He took up the newspapers, and threw them aside, one after another. Not
      one of the unfortunate writers and reporters could please him on that
      inauspicious day. It was only while he was lighting his second cigar that
      he remembered Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s unread letter to him. By this time, he was
      more than weary of his own affairs. He read the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find the people who have my happiness at their mercy both dilatory and
      greedy.&rdquo; (Mrs. Farnaby wrote); &ldquo;but the little that I can persuade them to
      tell me is very favourable to my hopes. I am still, to my annoyance, only
      in personal communication with the hateful old woman. The young man either
      sends messages, or writes to me through the post. By this latter means he
      has accurately described, not only in which of my child&rsquo;s feet the fault
      exists, but the exact position which it occupies. Here, you will agree
      with me, is positive evidence that he is speaking the truth, whoever he
      is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for this reassuring circumstance, I should feel inclined to be
      suspicious of some things&mdash;of the obstinate manner, for instance, in
      which the young man keeps himself concealed; also, of his privately
      warning me not to trust the woman who is his own messenger, and not to
      tell her on any account of the information which his letters convey to me.
      I feel that I ought to be cautious with him on the question of money&mdash;and
      yet, in my eagerness to see my darling, I am ready to give him all that he
      asks for. In this uncertain state of mind, I am restrained, strangely
      enough, by the old woman herself. She warns me that he is the sort of man,
      if he once gets the money, to spare himself the trouble of earning it. It
      is the one hold I have over him (she says)&mdash;so I control the burning
      impatience that consumes me as well as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I must not attempt to describe my own state of mind. When I tell you
      that I am actually afraid of dying before I can give my sweet love the
      first kiss, you will understand and pity me. When night comes, I feel
      sometimes half mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I send you my present address, in the hope that you will write and cheer
      me a little. I must not ask you to come and see me yet. I am not fit for
      it&mdash;and, besides, I am under a promise, in the present state of the
      negotiations, to shut the door on my friends. It is easy enough to do
      that; I have no friend, Amelius, but you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to feel compassionately towards me, my kind-hearted boy. For so many
      long years, my heart has had nothing to feed on but the one hope that is
      now being realized at last. No sympathy between my husband and me (on the
      contrary, a horrid unacknowledged enmity, which has always kept us apart);
      my father and mother, in their time both wretched about my marriage, and
      with good reason; my only sister dying in poverty&mdash;what a life for a
      childless woman! don&rsquo;t let us dwell on it any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye for the present, Amelius. I beg you will not think I am always
      wretched. When I want to be happy, I look to the coming time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This melancholy letter added to the depression that weighed on the spirits
      of Amelius. It inspired him with vague fears for Mrs. Farnaby. In her own
      interests, he would have felt himself tempted to consult Rufus (without
      mentioning names), if the American had been in London. As things were, he
      put the letter back in his pocket with a sigh. Even Mrs. Farnaby, in her
      sad moments, had a consoling prospect to contemplate. &ldquo;Everybody but me!&rdquo;
       Amelius thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reflections were interrupted by the appearance of an idle young member
      of the club, with whom he was acquainted. The new-comer remarked that he
      looked out of spirits, and suggested that they should dine together and
      amuse themselves somewhere in the evening. Amelius accepted the proposal:
      any man who offered him a refuge from himself was a friend to him on that
      day. Departing from his temperate habits, he deliberately drank more than
      usual. The wine excited him for the time, and then left him more depressed
      than ever; and the amusements of the evening produced the same result. He
      returned to his cottage so completely disheartened, that he regretted the
      day when he had left Tadmor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he kept his appointment, the next morning, to take leave of Regina.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was at the door, with a luggage-laden cab waiting behind it.
      Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s ill-temper vented itself in predictions that they would be
      too late to catch the train. His harsh voice, alternating with Regina&rsquo;s
      meek remonstrances, reached the ears of Amelius from the breakfast-room.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to wait for the gentleman-Socialist,&rdquo; Mr. Farnaby
      announced, with his hardest sarcasm of tone. &ldquo;Dear uncle, we have a
      quarter of an hour to spare!&rdquo; &ldquo;We have nothing of the sort; we want all
      that time to register the luggage.&rdquo; The servant&rsquo;s voice was heard next.
      &ldquo;Mr. Goldenheart, miss.&rdquo; Mr. Farnaby instantly stepped into the hall.
      &ldquo;Goodbye!&rdquo; he called to Amelius, through the open door of the dining-room&mdash;and
      passed straight on to the carriage. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t wait, Regina!&rdquo; he shouted,
      from the doorstep. &ldquo;Let him go by himself!&rdquo; said Amelius indignantly, as
      Regina hurried into the room. &ldquo;Oh, hush, hush, dear! Suppose he heard you?
      No week shall pass without my writing to you; promise you will write back,
      Amelius. One more kiss! Oh, my dear!&rdquo; The servant interposed, keeping
      discreetly out of sight. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, miss, my master wishes to
      know whether you are going with him or not.&rdquo; Regina waited to hear no
      more. She gave her lover a farewell look to remember her by, and ran out.
    </p>
    <p>
      That innate depravity which Amelius had lately discovered in his own
      nature, let the forbidden thoughts loose in him again as he watched the
      departing carriage from the door. &ldquo;If poor little Sally had been in her
      place&mdash;!&rdquo; He made an effort of virtuous resolution, and stopped
      there. &ldquo;What a blackguard a man may be,&rdquo; he penitently reflected, &ldquo;without
      suspecting it himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He descended the house-steps. The discreet servant wished him good
      morning, with a certain cheery respect&mdash;the man was delighted to have
      seen the last of his hard master for some months to come. Amelius stopped
      and turned round, smiling grimly. He was in such a reckless humour, that
      he was even ready to divert his mind by astonishing a footman. &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;are you engaged to be married?&rdquo; Richard stared in blank surprise
      at the strange question&mdash;and modestly admitted that he was engaged to
      marry the housemaid next door. &ldquo;Soon?&rdquo; asked Amelius, swinging his stick.
      &ldquo;As soon as I have saved a little more money, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Damn the money!&rdquo;
       cried Amelius&mdash;and struck his stick on the pavement, and walked away
      with a last look at the house as if he hated the sight of it. Richard
      watched the departing young gentleman, and shook his head ominously as he
      shut the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      Amelius went straight back to the cottage, with the one desperate purpose
      of reverting to the old plan, and burying himself in his books. Surveying
      his well-filled shelves with an impatience unworthy of a scholar, Hume&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;History of England&rdquo; unhappily caught his eye. He took down the first
      volume. In less than half an hour he discovered that Hume could do nothing
      for him. Wisely inspired, he turned to the truer history next, which men
      call fiction. The writings of the one supreme genius, who soars above all
      other novelists as Shakespeare soars above all other dramatists&mdash;the
      writings of Walter Scott&mdash;had their place of honour in his library.
      The collection of the Waverley Novels at Tadmor had not been complete.
      Enviable Amelius had still to read <i>Rob Roy.</i> He opened the book. For
      the rest of the day he was in love with Diana Vernon; and when he looked
      out once or twice at the garden to rest his eyes, he saw &ldquo;Andrew
      Fairservice&rdquo; busy over the flowerbeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the last page of the noble story as Toff came in to lay the
      cloth for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master at table and the servant behind his chair were accustomed to
      gossip pleasantly during meals. Amelius did his best to carry on the talk
      as usual. But he was no longer in the delightful world of illusion which
      Scott had opened to him. The hard realities of his own everyday life had
      gathered round him again. Observing him with unobtrusive attention, the
      Frenchman soon perceived the absence of the easy humour and the excellent
      appetite which distinguished his young master at other times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I venture to make a remark, sir?&rdquo; Toff inquired, after a long pause
      in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I take the liberty of expressing my sentiments freely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear sir, you have a pretty little simple dinner to-day,&rdquo; Toff began.
      &ldquo;Forgive me for praising myself, I am influenced by the natural pride of
      having cooked the dinner. For soup, you have Croute au pot; for meat, you
      have Tourne-dos a la sauce poivrade; for pudding, you have Pommes au
      beurre. All so nice&mdash;and you hardly eat anything, and your amiable
      conversation falls into a melancholy silence which fills me with regret.
      Is it you who are to blame for this? No, sir! it is the life you lead. I
      call it the life of a monk; I call it the life of a hermit&mdash;I say
      boldly it is the life of all others which is most unsympathetic to a young
      man like you. Pardon the warmth of my expressions; I am eager to make my
      language the language of utmost delicacy. May I quote a little song? It is
      in an old, old, old French piece, long since forgotten, called &lsquo;Les Maris
      Garcons&rsquo;. There are two lines in that song (I have often heard my good
      father sing them) which I will venture to apply to your case; &lsquo;Amour,
      delicatesse, et gaite; D&rsquo;un bon Francais c&rsquo;est la devise!&rsquo; Sir, you have
      naturally delicatesse and gaite&mdash;but the last has, for some days,
      been under a cloud. What is wanted to remove that cloud? L&rsquo;Amour! Love, as
      you say in English. Where is the charming woman, who is the only ornament
      wanting to this sweet cottage? Why is she still invisible? Remedy that
      unhappy oversight, sir. You are here in a suburban Paradise. I consult my
      long experience; and I implore you to invite Eve.&mdash;Ha! you smile;
      your lost gaiety returns, and you feel it as I do. Might I propose another
      glass of claret, and the reappearance on the table of the Tourne-dos a la
      poivrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to be melancholy in this man&rsquo;s company. Amelius
      sanctioned the return of the Tourne-dos, and tried the other glass of
      claret. &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; he said, with something like a return of his old
      easy way, &ldquo;you talk about charming women, and your long experience. Let&rsquo;s
      hear what your experience has been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Toff began to look a little confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have honoured me, sir, by calling me your good friend,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;After that, I am sure you will not send me away if I own the truth. No!
      My heart tells me I shall not appeal to your indulgence in vain. Dear sir,
      in the holidays which you kindly give me, I provide competent persons to
      take care of the house in my absence, don&rsquo;t I? One person, if you
      remember, was a most handsome engaging young man. He is, if you please, my
      son by my first wife&mdash;now an angel in heaven. Another person, who
      took care of the house, on the next occasion, was a little black-eyed boy;
      a miracle of discretion for his age. He is my son by my second wife&mdash;now
      another angel in heaven. Forgive me, I have not done yet. Some few days
      since, you thought you heard an infant crying downstairs. Like a miserable
      wretch, I lied; I declared it was the infant in the next house. Ah, sir,
      it was my own cherubim baby by my third wife&mdash;an angel close by in
      the Edgeware Road, established in a small milliner shop, which will expand
      to great things by-and-by. The intervals between my marriages are not
      worthy of your notice. Fugitive caprices, sir&mdash;fugitive caprices! To
      sum it all up (as you say in England), it is not in me to resist the
      enchanting sex. If my third angel dies, I shall tear my hair&mdash;but I
      shall none the less take a fourth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a dozen if you like,&rdquo; said Amelius. &ldquo;Why should you have kept all
      this from my knowledge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff hung his head. &ldquo;I think it was one of my foreign mistakes,&rdquo; he
      pleaded. &ldquo;The servants&rsquo; advertisements in your English newspapers frighten
      me. How does the most meritorious manservant announce himself when he
      wants the best possible place? He says he is &lsquo;without encumbrances.&rsquo; 
      Gracious heaven, what a dreadful word to describe the poor pretty harmless
      children! I was afraid, sir, you might have some English objection to <i>my</i>
      &lsquo;encumbrances.&rsquo; A young man, a boy, and a cherubim-baby; not to speak of
      the sacred memories of two women, and the charming occasional society of a
      third; all inextricably enveloped in the life of one amorous-meritorious
      French person&mdash;surely there was reason for hesitation here? No
      matter; I bless my stars I know better now, and I withdraw myself from
      further notice. Permit me to recall your attention to the Roquefort
      cheese, and a mouthful of potato-salad to correct the richness of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was over at last. Amelius was alone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a still evening. Not a breath of wind stirred among the trees in
      the garden; no vehicles passed along the by-road in which the cottage
      stood. Now and then, Toff was audible downstairs, singing French songs in
      a high cracked voice, while he washed the plates and dishes, and set
      everything in order for the night. Amelius looked at his bookshelves&mdash;and
      felt that, after <i>Rob Roy,</i> there was no more reading for him that
      evening. The slow minutes followed one another wearily; the deadly
      depression of the earlier hours of the day was stealthily fastening its
      hold on him again. How might he best resist it? His healthy out-of-door
      habits at Tadmor suggested the only remedy that he could think of. Be his
      troubles what they might, his one simple method of resisting them, at all
      other times, was his simple method now. He went out for a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two hours he rambled about the great north-western suburb of London.
      Perhaps he felt the heavy oppressive weather, or perhaps his good dinner
      had not agreed with him. Any way, he was so thoroughly worn out, that he
      was obliged to return to the cottage in a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toff opened the door&mdash;but not with his customary alacrity. Amelius
      was too completely fatigued to notice any trifling circumstance.
      Otherwise, he would certainly have perceived something odd in the old
      Frenchman&rsquo;s withered face. He looked at his master, as he relieved him of
      his hat and coat, with the strangest expression of interest and anxiety;
      modified by a certain sardonic sense of amusement underlying the more
      serious emotions. &ldquo;A nasty dull evening,&rdquo; Amelius said wearily. And Toff,
      always eager to talk at other times, only answered, &ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo;&mdash;and
      retreated at once to the kitchen regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was bright; the curtains were drawn; the reading-lamp, with its
      ample green shade, was on the table&mdash;a more comfortable room no man
      could have found to receive him after a long walk. Reclining at his ease
      in his chair, Amelius thought of ringing for some restorative
      brandy-and-water. While he was thinking, he fell asleep; and, while he
      slept, he dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it a dream?
    </p>
    <p>
      He certainly saw the library&mdash;not fantastically transformed, but just
      like what the room really was. So far, he might have been wide awake,
      looking at the familiar objects round him. But, after a while, an event
      happened which set the laws of reality at defiance. Simple Sally, miles
      away in the Home, made her appearance in the library, nevertheless. He saw
      the drawn curtains over the window parted from behind; he saw the girl
      step out from them, and stop, looking at him timidly. She was clothed in
      the plain dress that he had bought for her; and she looked more charming
      in it than ever. The beauty of health claimed kindred now, in her pretty
      face, with the beauty of youth: the wan cheeks had begun to fill out, and
      the pale lips were delicately suffused with their natural rosy red. Little
      by little her first fears seemed to subside. She smiled, and softly
      crossed the room, and stood at his side. After looking at him with a rapt
      expression of tenderness and delight, she laid her hands on the arm of the
      chair, and said, in the quaintly quiet way which he remembered so well, &ldquo;I
      want to kiss you.&rdquo; She bent over him, and kissed him with the innocent
      freedom of a child. Then she raised herself again, and looked backwards
      and forwards between Amelius and the lamp. &ldquo;The firelight is the best,&rdquo;
       she said. Darkness fell over the room as she spoke; he saw her no more; he
      heard her no more. A blank interval followed; there flowed over him the
      oblivion of perfect sleep. His next conscious sensation was a feeling of
      cold&mdash;he shivered, and woke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression of the dream was in his mind at the moment of waking. He
      started as he raised himself in the chair. Was he dreaming still? No; he
      was certainly awake. And, as certainly, the room was dark!
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked and looked. It was not to be denied, or explained away. There
      was the fire burning low, and leaving the room chilly&mdash;and there,
      just visible on the table, in the flicker of the dying flame, was the
      extinguished lamp!
    </p>
    <p>
      He mended the fire, and put his hand on the bell to ring for Toff, and
      thought better of it. What need had he of the lamplight? He was too weary
      for reading; he preferred going to sleep again, and dreaming again of
      Sally. Where was the harm in dreaming of the poor little soul, so far away
      from him? The happiest part of his life now was the part of it that was
      passed in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the fresh coals began to kindle feebly, he looked again at the lamp. It
      was odd, to say the least of it, that the light should have accidentally
      gone out, exactly at the right time to realize the fanciful extinction of
      it in his dream. How was it there was no smell of a burnt-out lamp? He was
      too lazy, or too tired, to pursue the question. Let the mystery remain a
      mystery&mdash;and let him rest in peace! He settled himself fretfully in
      his chair. What a fool he was to bother his head about a lamp, instead of
      closing his eyes and going to sleep again!
    </p>
    <p>
      The room began to recover its pleasant temperature. He shifted the cushion
      in the chair, so that it supported his head in perfect comfort, and
      composed himself to rest. But the capricious influences of sleep had
      deserted him: he tried one position after another, and all in vain. It was
      a mere mockery even to shut his eyes. He resigned himself to
      circumstances, and stretched out his legs, and looked at the companionable
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of late he had thought more frequently than usual of his past days in the
      Community. His mind went back again now to that bygone time. The clock on
      the mantelpiece struck nine. They were all at supper, at Tadmor&mdash;talking
      over the events of the day. He saw himself again at the long wooden table,
      with shy little Mellicent in the chair next to him, and his favourite dog
      at his feet waiting to be fed. Where was Mellicent now? It was a sad
      letter that she had written to him, with the strange fixed idea that he
      was to return to her one day. There was something very winning and lovable
      about the poor creature who had lived such a hard life at home, and had
      suffered so keenly. It was a comfort to think that she would go back to
      the Community. What happier destiny could she hope for? Would she take
      care of his dog for him when she went back? They had all promised to be
      kind to his pet animals in his absence; but the dog was fond of Mellicent;
      he would be happier with Mellicent than with the rest of them. And his
      little tame fawn, and his birds&mdash;how were they doing? He had not even
      written to inquire after them; he had been cruelly forgetful of those
      harmless dumb loving friends. In his present solitude, in his dreary
      doubts of the future, what would he not give to feel the dog nestling in
      his bosom, and the fawn&rsquo;s little rough tongue licking his hand! His heart
      ached as he thought of it: a choking hysterical sensation oppressed his
      breathing. He tried to rise, and ring for lights, and rouse his manhood to
      endure and resist. It was not to be done. Where was his courage? where was
      the cheerfulness which had never failed him at other time? He sank back in
      the chair, and hid his face in his hands for shame at his own weakness,
      and burst out crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The touch of soft persuasive fingers suddenly thrilled through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hands were gently drawn away from his face; a familiar voice, sweet
      and low, said, &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo; Dimly through his tears he saw the
      well-remembered little figure standing between him and the fire. In his
      unendurable loneliness, he had longed for his dog, he had longed for his
      fawn. There was the martyred creature from the streets, whom he had
      rescued from nameless horror, waiting to be his companion, servant,
      friend! There was the child-victim of cold and hunger, still only feeling
      her way to womanhood; innocent of all other aspirations, so long as she
      might fill the place which had once been occupied by the dog and the fawn!
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked at her with a momentary doubt whether he was waking or
      sleeping. &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;am I dreaming again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, simply. &ldquo;You are awake this time. Let me dry your eyes; I
      know where you put your handkerchief.&rdquo; She perched on his knee, and wiped
      away the tears, and smoothed his hair over his forehead. &ldquo;I was frightened
      to show myself till I heard you crying,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;Then I thought,
      &lsquo;Come! he can&rsquo;t be angry with me now&rsquo;&mdash;and I crept out from behind
      the curtains there. The old man let me in. I can&rsquo;t live without seeing
      you; I&rsquo;ve tried till I could try no longer. I owned it to the old man when
      he opened the door. I said, &lsquo;I only want to look at him; won&rsquo;t you let me
      in?&rsquo; And he says, &lsquo;God bless me, here&rsquo;s Eve come already!&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know
      what he meant&mdash;he let me in, that&rsquo;s all I care about. He&rsquo;s a funny
      old foreigner. Send him away; I&rsquo;m to be your servant now. Why were you
      crying? I&rsquo;ve cried often enough about You. No; that can&rsquo;t be&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      expect you to cry about <i>me;</i> I can only expect you to scold me. I
      know I&rsquo;m a bad girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She cast one doubtful look at him, and hung her head&mdash;waiting to be
      scolded. Amelius lost all control over himself. He took her in his arms
      and kissed her again and again. &ldquo;You are a dear good grateful little
      creature!&rdquo; he burst out&mdash;and suddenly stopped, aware too late of the
      act of imprudence which he had committed. He put her away from him; he
      tried to ask severe questions, and to administer merited reproof. Even if
      he had succeeded, Sally was too happy to listen to him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right
      now,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never, never, never to go back to the Home! Oh, I&rsquo;m
      so happy! Let&rsquo;s light the lamp again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She found the matchbox on the chimneypiece. In a minute more the room was
      bright. Amelius sat looking at her, perfectly incapable of deciding what
      he ought to say or do next. To complete his bewilderment, the voice of the
      attentive old Frenchman made itself heard through the door, in discreetly
      confidential tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have prepared an appetising little supper, sir,&rdquo; said Toff. &ldquo;Be pleased
      to ring when you and the young lady are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      Toff&rsquo;s interference proved to have its use. The announcement of the little
      supper&mdash;plainly implying Simple Sally&rsquo;s reception at the cottage&mdash;reminded
      Amelius of his responsibilities. He at once stepped out into the passage,
      and closed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Frenchman was waiting to be reprimanded or thanked, as the case
      might be, with his head down, his shoulders shrugged up to his ears, and
      the palms of his hands spread out appealingly on either side of him&mdash;a
      model of mute resignation to circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that you have put me in a very awkward position?&rdquo; Amelius
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toff lifted one of his hands to his heart. &ldquo;You are aware of my weakness,
      sir. When that charming little creature presented herself at the door,
      sinking with fatigue, I could no more resist her than I could take a
      hop-skip-and-jump over the roof of this cottage. If I have done wrong,
      take no account of the proud fidelity with which I have served you&mdash;tell
      me to pack up and go; but don&rsquo;t ask me to assume a position of severity
      towards that enchanting Miss. It is not in my heart to do it,&rdquo; said Toff,
      lifting his eyes with tearful solemnity to an imaginary heaven. &ldquo;On my
      sacred word of honour as a Frenchman, I would die rather than do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rdquo; Amelius rejoined a little impatiently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      blame you&mdash;but you have got me into a scrape, for all that. If I did
      my duty, I should send for a cab, and take her back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff opened his twinkling old eyes in a perfect transport of astonishment.
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;take her back? Without rest, without supper? And you
      call that duty? How inconceivably ugly does duty look when it assumes an
      inhospitable aspect towards a woman! Pardon me, sir; I must express my
      sentiments or I shall burst. You will say perhaps that I have no
      conception of duty? Pardon me again&mdash;my conception of duty is <i>here!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw open the door of the sitting-room. In spite of his anxiety,
      Amelius burst out laughing. The Frenchman&rsquo;s inexhaustible contrivances had
      transformed the sitting-room into a bedroom for Sally. The sofa had become
      a snug little white bed; a hairbrush and comb, and a bottle of
      eau-de-cologne, were on the table; a bath stood near the fire, with cans
      of hot and cold water, and a railway rug placed under them to save the
      carpet. &ldquo;I dare not presume to contradict you, sir,&rdquo; said Toff, &ldquo;but there
      is <i>my</i> conception of duty! In the kitchen, I have another
      conception, keeping warm; you can smell it up the stairs. Salmi of
      partridge, with the littlest possible dash of garlic in the sauce. Oh,
      sir, let that angel rest and refresh herself! Virtuous severity, believe
      me, is a most horribly unbecoming virtue at your age!&rdquo; He spoke quite
      seriously, with the air of a profound moralist, asserting principles that
      did equal honour to his head and his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius went back to the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally was resting in the easy-chair; her position showed plainly that she
      was suffering from fatigue. &ldquo;I have had a long, long walk,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and
      I don&rsquo;t know which aches worst, my back or my feet. I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      quite happy now I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; She nestled herself comfortably in the chair.
      &ldquo;Do you mind my looking at you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s so long since I saw
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a new undertone of tenderness in her voice&mdash;innocent
      tenderness that openly avowed itself. The reviving influences of the life
      at the Home had done much&mdash;and had much yet left to do. Her wasted
      face and figure were filling out, her cheeks and lips were regaining their
      lovely natural colour, as Amelius had seen in his dream. But her eyes, in
      repose, still resumed their vacantly patient look; and her manner, with a
      perceptible increase of composure and confidence, had not lost its quaint
      childish charm. Her growth from girl to woman was a growth of fine
      gradations, guided by the unerring deliberation of Nature and Time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they will follow you here, from the Home?&rdquo; Amelius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the clock. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hours
      since I slipped out by the back door. They have very strict rules about
      runaway girls&mdash;even when their friends bring them back. If <i>you</i>
      send me back&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped, and looked thoughtfully into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do, if I send you back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What one of our girls did, before they took her in at the Home. She
      jumped into the river. &lsquo;Made a hole in the water&rsquo;; that&rsquo;s how she calls
      it. She&rsquo;s a big strong girl; and they got her out, and saved her. She says
      it wasn&rsquo;t painful, till they brought her to again. I&rsquo;m little and weak&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t think they could bring <i>me</i> to life, if they tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius made a futile attempt to reason with her. He even got so far as to
      tell her that she had done very wrong to leave the Home. Sally&rsquo;s answer
      set all further expostulation at defiance. Instead of attempting to defend
      herself, she sighed wearily, and said, &ldquo;I had no money; I walked all the
      way here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The well-intended remonstrances of Amelius were lost in compassionate
      surprise. &ldquo;You poor little soul!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it must be seven or eight
      miles at least!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; said Sally. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t matter, now I&rsquo;ve found you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you find me? Who told you where I lived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and took from her bosom the photograph of the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mrs. Payson cut off the address!&rdquo; cried Amelius, bursting out with
      the truth in the impulse of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally turned over the photograph, and pointed to the back of the card, on
      which the photographer&rsquo;s name and address were printed. &ldquo;Mrs. Payson
      didn&rsquo;t think of this,&rdquo; she said shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did <i>you</i> think of it?&rdquo; Amelius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too stupid,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;The girl who made
      the hole in the water put me up to it. &lsquo;Have you made up your mind to run
      away?&rsquo; she says. And I said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;You go to the man who did the
      picture,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;he knows where the place is, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rsquo; I asked
      my way till I found him. And he did know. And he told me. He was a good
      sort; he gave me a glass of beer, he said I looked so tired. I said we&rsquo;d
      go and have our portraits taken some day&mdash;you, and your servant. May
      I tell the funny old foreigner that he is to go away now I have come to
      you?&rdquo; The complete simplicity with which she betrayed her jealousy of Toff
      made Amelius smile. Sally, watching every change in his face, instantly
      drew her own conclusion. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep your room
      cleaner than he keeps it! I smelt dust on the curtains when I was hiding
      from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius thought of his dream. &ldquo;Did you come out while I was asleep?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I wasn&rsquo;t frightened of you, when you were asleep. I had a good look
      at you; and I gave you a kiss.&rdquo; She made that confession without the
      slightest sign of confusion; her calm blue eyes looked him straight in the
      face. &ldquo;You got restless,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;and I got frightened again. I put
      out the lamp. I says to myself, &lsquo;If he does scold me, I can bear it better
      in the dark.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius listened, wondering. Had he seen drowsily what he thought he had
      dreamed, or was there some mysterious sympathy between Sally and himself?
      The occult speculations were interrupted by Sally. &ldquo;May I take off my
      bonnet, and make myself tidy?&rdquo; she asked. Some men might have said No.
      Amelius was not one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library possessed a door of communication with the sitting-room; the
      bedchamber occupied by Amelius being on the other side of the cottage.
      When Sally saw Toff&rsquo;s reconstructed room, she stood at the door, in
      speechless admiration of the vision of luxury revealed to her. From time
      to time Amelius, alone in the library, heard her dabbling in her bath, and
      humming the artless old English song from which she had taken her name.
      Once she knocked at the closed door, and made a request through it&mdash;&ldquo;There
      is scent on the table; may I have some?&rdquo; And once Toff knocked at the
      other door, opening into the passage, and asked when &ldquo;pretty young Miss&rdquo;
       would be ready for supper. Events went on in the little household as if
      Sally had become an integral part of it already. &ldquo;What <i>am</i> I to do?&rdquo;
       Amelius asked himself. And Toff, entering at the moment to lay the cloth,
      answered respectfully, &ldquo;Hurry the young person, sir, or the salmi will be
      spoilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came out from her room, walking delicately on her sore feet&mdash;so
      fresh and charming, that Toff, absorbed in admiration, made a mistake in
      folding a napkin for the first time in his life. &ldquo;Champagne, of course,
      sir?&rdquo; he said in confidence to Amelius. The salmi of partridge appeared;
      the inspiriting wine sparkled in the glasses; Toff surpassed himself in
      all the qualities which made a servant invaluable at a supper table. Sally
      forgot the Home, forgot the cruel streets, and laughed and chattered as
      gaily as the happiest girl living. Amelius, expanding in the joyous
      atmosphere of youth and good spirits, shook off his sense of
      responsibility, and became once more the delightful companion who won
      everybody&rsquo;s love. The effervescent gaiety of the evening was at its
      climax; the awful forms of duty, propriety, and good sense had been long
      since laughed out of the room&mdash;when Nemesis, goddess of retribution,
      announced her arrival outside, by a crashing of carriage-wheels and a
      peremptory ring at the cottage bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was dead silence; Amelius and Sally looked at each other. The
      experienced Toff at once guessed what had happened. &ldquo;Is it her father or
      mother?&rdquo; he asked of Amelius, a little anxiously. Hearing that she had
      never even seen her father or mother, he snapped his fingers joyously, and
      led the way on tiptoe into the hall. &ldquo;I have my idea,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Let
      us listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A woman&rsquo;s voice, high, clear, and resolute, speaking apparently to the
      coachman, was the next audible sound. &ldquo;Say I come from Mrs. Payson, and
      must see Mr. Goldenheart directly.&rdquo; Sally trembled and turned pale. &ldquo;The
      matron!&rdquo; she said faintly. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let her in!&rdquo; Amelius took the
      terrified girl back to the library. Toff followed them, respectfully
      asking to be told what a &ldquo;matron&rdquo; was. Receiving the necessary
      explanation, he expressed his contempt for matrons bent on carrying
      charming persons into captivity, by opening the library door and spitting
      into the hall. Having relieved his mind in this way, he returned to his
      master and laid a lank skinny forefinger cunningly along the side of his
      nose. &ldquo;I suppose, sir, you don&rsquo;t want to see this furious woman?&rdquo; he said.
      Before it was possible to say anything in reply, another ring at the bell
      announced that the furious woman wanted to see Amelius. Toff read his
      master&rsquo;s wishes in his master&rsquo;s face. Not even this emergency could find
      him unprepared: he was as ready to circumvent a matron as to cook a
      dinner. &ldquo;The shutters are up, and the curtains are drawn,&rdquo; he reminded
      Amelius. &ldquo;Not a morsel of light is visible outside. Let them ring&mdash;we
      have all gone to bed.&rdquo; He turned to Sally, grinning with impish enjoyment
      of his own stratagem. &ldquo;Ha, Miss! what do you think of that?&rdquo; There was a
      third pull at the bell as he spoke. &ldquo;Ring away, Missess Matrone!&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;We are fast asleep&mdash;wake us if you can.&rdquo; The fourth ring was
      the last. A sharp crack revealed the breaking of the bellwire, and was
      followed by the shrill fall of the iron handle on the pavement before the
      garden gate. The gate, like the palings, was protected at the top from
      invading cats. &ldquo;Compose yourself, Miss,&rdquo; said Toff, &ldquo;if she tries to get
      over the gate, she will stick on the spikes.&rdquo; In another moment, the sound
      of retiring carriage-wheels announced the defeat of the matron, and
      settled the serious question of receiving Sally for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat silent by the window, when Toff had left the room, holding back
      the curtains and looking out at the murky sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; Amelius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking for the stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius joined her at the window. &ldquo;There are no stars to be seen tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She let the curtain fall to again. &ldquo;I was thinking of night-time at the
      Home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You see, I got on pretty well, in the day, with my
      reading and writing. I wanted so to improve myself. My mind was troubled
      with the fear of your despising such an ignorant creature as I am; so I
      kept on at my lessons. I thought I might surprise you by writing you a
      pretty letter some day. One of the teachers (she&rsquo;s gone away ill) was very
      good to me. I used to talk to her; and, when I said a wrong word, she took
      me up, and told me the right one. She said you would think better of me
      when you heard me speak properly&mdash;and I do speak better, don&rsquo;t I? All
      this was in the day. It was the night that was the hard time to get
      through&mdash;when the other girls were all asleep, and I had nothing to
      think of but how far away I was from you. I used to get up, and put the
      counterpane round me, and stand at the window. On fine nights the stars
      were company to me. There were two stars, near together, that I got to
      know. Don&rsquo;t laugh at me&mdash;I used to think one of them was you, and one
      of them me. I wondered whether you would die, or I should die, before I
      saw you again. And, most always, it was my star that went out first. Lord,
      how I used to cry! It got into my poor stupid head that I should never see
      you again. I do believe I ran away because of that. You won&rsquo;t tell
      anybody, will you? It was so foolish, I am ashamed of it now. I wanted to
      see your star and my star tonight. I don&rsquo;t know why. Oh, I&rsquo;m so fond of
      you!&rdquo; She dropped on her knees, and took his hand, and put it on her head.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s burning hot,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and your kind hand cools it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius raised her gently, and led her to the door of her room. &ldquo;My poor
      Sally, you are quite worn out. You want rest and sleep. Let us say good
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do anything you tell me,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;If Mrs. Payson comes
      tomorrow, you won&rsquo;t let her take me away? Thank you. Goodnight.&rdquo; She put
      her hands on his shoulders, with innocent familiarity, and lifted herself
      to him on tiptoe, and kissed him as a sister might have kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after Sally was asleep in her bed, Amelius sat by the library fire,
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revival of the crushed feeling and fancy in the girl&rsquo;s nature, so
      artlessly revealed in her sad little story of the stars that were &ldquo;company
      to her,&rdquo; not only touched and interested him, but clouded his view of the
      future with doubts and anxieties which had never troubled him until that
      moment. The mysterious influences under which the girl&rsquo;s development was
      advancing were working morally and physically together. Weeks might pass
      harmlessly, months might pass harmlessly&mdash;but the time must come when
      the innocent relations between them would be beset by peril. Unable, as
      yet, fully to realize these truths, Amelius nevertheless felt them
      vaguely. His face was troubled, as he lit the candle at last to go to his
      bed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see my way as clearly as I could wish,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;How
      will it end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How indeed!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock the next morning, Amelius was awakened by Toff. A letter
      had arrived, marked &ldquo;Immediate,&rdquo; and the messenger was waiting for an
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was from Mrs. Payson. She wrote briefly, and in formal terms.
      After referring to the matron&rsquo;s fruitless visit to the cottage on the
      previous night, Mrs. Payson proceeded in these words:&mdash;&ldquo;I request you
      will immediately let me know whether Sally has taken refuge with you, and
      has passed the night under your roof. If I am right in believing that she
      has done so, I have only to inform you that the doors of the Home are
      henceforth closed to her, in conformity with our rules. If I am wrong, it
      will be my painful duty to lose no time in placing the matter in the hands
      of the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius began his reply, acting on impulse as usual. He wrote, vehemently
      remonstrating with Mrs. Payson on the unforgiving and unchristian nature
      of the rules at the Home. Before he was halfway through his composition,
      the person who had brought the letter sent a message to say that he was
      expected back immediately, and that he hoped Mr. Goldenheart would not get
      a poor man into trouble by keeping him much longer. Checked in the full
      flow of his eloquence, Amelius angrily tore up the unfinished
      remonstrance, and matched Mrs. Payson&rsquo;s briefly business-like language by
      an answer in one line:&mdash;&ldquo;I beg to inform you that you are quite
      right.&rdquo; On reflection, he felt that the second letter was not only
      discourteous as a reply to a lady, but also ungrateful as addressed to
      Mrs. Payson personally. At the third attempt, he wrote becomingly as well
      as briefly. &ldquo;Sally has passed the night here, as my guest. She was
      suffering from severe fatigue; it would have been an act of downright
      inhumanity to send her away. I regret your decision, but of course I
      submit to it. You once said, you believed implicitly in the purity of my
      motives. Do me the justice, however you may blame my conduct, to believe
      in me still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having despatched these lines, the mind of Amelius was at ease again, He
      went into the library, and listened to hear if Sally was moving. The
      perfect silence on the other side of the door informed him that the weary
      girl was still fast asleep. He gave directions that she was on no account
      to be disturbed, and sat down to breakfast by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was still at table, Toff appeared, with profound mystery in his
      manner, and discreet confidence in the tones of his voice. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another
      one, sir!&rdquo; the Frenchman announced, in his master&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another one?&rdquo; Amelius repeated. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not like the sweet little sleeping Miss.&rdquo; Toff explained. &ldquo;This
      time, sir, it&rsquo;s the beauty of the devil himself, as we say in France. She
      refuses to confide in me; and she appears to be agitated&mdash;both bad
      signs. Shall I get rid of her before the other Miss wakes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she got a name?&rdquo; Amelius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toff answered, in his foreign accent, &ldquo;One name only&mdash;Faybay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean Phoebe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not said it, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show her in directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff glanced at the door of Sally&rsquo;s room, shrugged his shoulders, and
      obeyed his instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe appeared, looking pale and anxious. Her customary assurance of
      manner had completely deserted her: she stopped in the doorway, as if she
      was afraid to enter the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, and sit down,&rdquo; said Amelius. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m troubled in my mind, sir,&rdquo; Phoebe answered. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s taking a
      liberty to come to you. But I went yesterday to ask Miss Regina&rsquo;s advice,
      and found she had gone abroad with her uncle. I have something to say
      about Mrs. Farnaby, sir; and there&rsquo;s no time to be lost in saying it. I
      know of nobody but you that I can speak to, now Miss Regina is away. The
      footman told me where you lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, evidently in the greatest embarrassment. Amelius tried to
      encourage her. &ldquo;If I can be of any use to Mrs. Farnaby,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me
      at once what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe&rsquo;s eyes dropped before his straightforward look as he spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must ask you to please excuse my mentioning names, sir,&rdquo; she resumed
      confusedly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a person I&rsquo;m interested in, whom I wouldn&rsquo;t get into
      trouble for the whole world. He&rsquo;s been misled&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s been
      misled by another person&mdash;a wicked drunken old woman, who ought to be
      in prison if she had her deserts. I&rsquo;m not free from blame myself&mdash;I
      know I&rsquo;m not. I listened, sir, to what I oughtn&rsquo;t to have heard; and I
      told it again (I&rsquo;m sure in the strictest confidence, and not meaning
      anything wrong) to the person I&rsquo;ve mentioned. Not the old women&mdash;I
      mean the person I&rsquo;m interested in. I hope you understand me, sir? I wish
      to speak openly, excepting the names, on account of Mrs. Farnaby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius thought of Phoebe&rsquo;s vindictive language the last time he had seen
      her. He looked towards a cabinet in a corner of the room, in which he had
      placed Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s letter. An instinctive distrust of his visitor began
      to rise in his mind. His manner altered&mdash;he turned to his plate, and
      went on with his breakfast. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you speak to me plainly?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is
      Mrs. Farnaby in any trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can I do anything to help her out of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you can, sir&mdash;if you only know where to find her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do know where to find her. She has written to tell me. The last time I
      saw you, you expressed yourself very improperly about Mrs. Farnaby; you
      spoke as if you meant some harm to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean nothing but good to her now, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then. Can&rsquo;t you go and speak to her yourself, if I give you
      the address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe&rsquo;s pale face flushed a little. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do that, sir,&rdquo; she
      answered, &ldquo;after the way Mrs. Farnaby has treated me. Besides, if she knew
      that I had listened to what passed between her and you&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped
      again, more painfully embarrassed than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius laid down his knife and fork. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;this sort of
      thing is not in my way. If you can&rsquo;t make a clean breast of it, let&rsquo;s talk
      of something else. I&rsquo;m very much afraid,&rdquo; he went on, with his customary
      absence of all concealment, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not the harmless sort of girl I once
      took you for. What do you mean by &lsquo;what passed between Mrs. Farnaby and
      me&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe put her handkerchief to her eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard to speak to me so
      harshly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when I&rsquo;m sorry for what I&rsquo;ve done, and am only
      anxious to prevent harm coming of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;What</i> have you done?&rdquo; cried honest Amelius, weary of the woman&rsquo;s
      inveterately indirect way of explaining herself to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flash of his quick temper in his eyes, as he put that straightforward
      question, roused a responsive temper in Phoebe which stung her into
      speaking openly at last. She told Amelius what she had heard in the
      kitchen as plainly as she had told it to Jervy&mdash;with this one
      difference, that she spoke without insolence when she referred to Mrs.
      Farnaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listening in silence until she had done, Amelius started to his feet, and
      opening the cabinet, took from it Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s letter. He read the
      letter, keeping his back towards Phoebe&mdash;waited a moment thinking&mdash;and
      suddenly turned on the woman with a look that made her shrink in her
      chair. &ldquo;You wretch!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you detestable wretch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the terror of the moment, Phoebe attempted to leave the room. Amelius
      stopped her instantly. &ldquo;Sit down again,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I mean to have the
      whole truth out of you, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe recovered her courage. &ldquo;You have had the whole truth, sir; I could
      tell you no more if I was on my deathbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius refused to believe her. &ldquo;There is a vile conspiracy against Mrs.
      Farnaby,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me you are not in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me God, sir, I never even heard of it till yesterday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone in which she spoke shook the conviction of Amelius; the
      indescribable ring of truth was in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two people who are cruelly deluding and plundering this poor
      lady,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, if you remember, that I couldn&rsquo;t mention names, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked again at the letter. After what he had heard, there was no
      difficulty in identifying the invisible &ldquo;young man,&rdquo; alluded to by Mrs.
      Farnaby, with the unnamed &ldquo;person&rdquo; in whom Phoebe was interested. Who was
      he? As the question passed through his mind, Amelius remembered the
      vagabond whom he had recognized with Phoebe, in the street. There was no
      doubt of it now&mdash;the man who was directing the conspiracy in the dark
      was Jervy! Amelius would unquestionably have been rash enough to reveal
      this discovery, if Phoebe had not stopped him. His renewed reference to
      Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s letter and his sudden silence after looking at it roused
      the woman&rsquo;s suspicions. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re planning to get my friend into
      trouble,&rdquo; she burst out, &ldquo;not another word shall pass my lips!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Amelius profited by the warning which that threat unintentionally
      conveyed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your own secrets,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I only want to spare Mrs. Farnaby a
      dreadful disappointment. But I must know what I am talking about when I go
      to her. Can&rsquo;t you tell me how you found out this abominable swindle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe was perfectly willing to tell him. Interpreting her long involved
      narrative into plain English, with the names added, these were the facts
      related:&mdash;Mrs. Sowler, bearing in mind some talk which had passed
      between them on the occasion of a supper, had called at Phoebe&rsquo;s lodgings
      on the previous day, and had tried to entrap her into communicating what
      she knew of Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s secrets. The trap failing, Mrs. Sowler had
      tried bribery next; had promised Phoebe a large sum of money, to be
      equally divided between them, if she would only speak; had declared that
      Jervy was perfectly capable of breaking his promise of marriage, and
      &ldquo;leaving them both in the lurch, if he once got the money into his own
      pocket&rdquo; and had thus informed Phoebe, that the conspiracy, which she
      supposed to have been abandoned, was really in full progress, without her
      knowledge. She had temporised with Mrs. Sowler, being afraid to set such a
      person openly at defiance; and had hurried away at once, to have an
      explanation with Jervy. He was reported to be &ldquo;not at home.&rdquo; Her fruitless
      visit to Regina had followed&mdash;and there, so far as facts were
      concerned, was an end of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius asked her no questions, and spoke as briefly as possible when she
      had done. &ldquo;I will go to Mrs. Farnaby this morning,&rdquo; was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you please let me hear how it ends?&rdquo; Phoebe asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius pushed his pocket-book and pencil across the table to her,
      pointing to a blank leaf on which she could write her address. While she
      was thus employed the attentive Toff came in, and (with his eye on Phoebe)
      whispered in his master&rsquo;s ear. He had heard Sally moving about. Would it
      be more convenient, under the circumstances, if she had her breakfast in
      her own room? Toff&rsquo;s astonishment was a sight to see when Amelius
      answered, &ldquo;Certainly not. Let her breakfast here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phoebe rose to go. Her parting words revealed the double-sided nature that
      was in her; the good and evil in perpetual conflict which should be
      uppermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t mention me, sir, to Mrs. Farnaby,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      forgive her for what she&rsquo;s done to me; I don&rsquo;t say I won&rsquo;t be even with
      her yet. But not in <i>that</i> way! I won&rsquo;t have her death laid at my
      door. Oh, but I know her temper&mdash;and I say it&rsquo;s as likely as not to
      kill her or drive her mad, if she isn&rsquo;t warned about it in time. Never
      mind her losing her money. If it&rsquo;s lost, it&rsquo;s lost, and she&rsquo;s got plenty
      more. She may be robbed a dozen times over for all I care. But don&rsquo;t let
      her set her heart on seeing her child, and then find it&rsquo;s all a swindle. I
      hate her; but I can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t, let <i>that</i> go on. Good-morning,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius was relieved by her departure. For a minute or two, he sat
      absently stirring his coffee, and considering how he might most safely
      perform the terrible duty of putting Mrs. Farnaby on her guard. Toff
      interrupted his meditations by preparing the table for Sally&rsquo;s breakfast;
      and, almost at the same moment, Sally herself, fresh and rosy, opened her
      door a little way, and looked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had a fine long sleep,&rdquo; said Amelius. &ldquo;Have you quite got over
      your walk yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; she answered gaily; &ldquo;I only feel my long walk now in my feet. It
      hurts me to put my boots on. Can you lend me a pair of slippers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pair of my slippers? Why, Sally, you would be lost in them! What&rsquo;s the
      matter with your feet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re both sore. And I think one of them has got a blister on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, and let&rsquo;s have a look at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came limping in, with her feet bare. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scold me,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;I
      couldn&rsquo;t put my stockings on again, without washing them; and they&rsquo;re not
      dry yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you new stockings and slippers,&rdquo; said Amelius. &ldquo;Which is the
      foot with the blister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The left foot,&rdquo; she answered, pointing to it.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Let me see the blister,&rdquo; said Amelius.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sally looked longingly at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I warm my feet first?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;they are so cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In those words she innocently deferred the discovery which, if it had been
      made at the moment, might have altered the whole after-course of events.
      Amelius only thought now of preventing her from catching cold. He sent
      Toff for a pair of the warmest socks that he possessed, and asked if he
      should put them on for her. She smiled, and shook her head, and put them
      on for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had done laughing at the absurd appearance of the little feet in
      the large socks, they only drifted farther and farther away from the
      subject of the blistered foot. Sally remembered the terrible matron, and
      asked if anything had been heard of her that morning. Being told that Mrs.
      Payson had written, and that the doors of the institution were closed to
      her, she recovered her spirits, and began to wonder whether the offended
      authorities would let her have her clothes. Toff offered to go and make
      the inquiry, later in the day; suggesting the purchase of slippers and
      stockings, in the mean time, while Sally was having her breakfast. Amelius
      approved of the suggestion; and Toff set off on his errand, with one of
      Sally&rsquo;s boots for a pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning had, by that time, advanced to ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius stood before the fire talking, while Sally had her breakfast.
      Having first explained the reasons which made it impossible that she
      should live at the cottage in the capacity of his servant, he astonished
      her by announcing that he meant to undertake the superintendence of her
      education himself. They were to be master and pupil, while the lessons
      were in progress; and brother and sister at other times&mdash;and they
      were to see how they got on together, on this plan, without indulging in
      any needless anxiety about the future. Amelius believed with perfect
      sincerity that he had hit on the only sensible arrangement, under the
      circumstances; and Sally cried joyously, &ldquo;Oh, how good you are to me; the
      happy life has come at last!&rdquo; At the hour when those words passed the
      daughter&rsquo;s lips, the discovery of the conspiracy burst upon the mother in
      all its baseness and in all its horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suspicion of her infamous employer, which had induced Mrs. Sowler to
      attempt to intrude herself into Phoebe&rsquo;s confidence, led her to make a
      visit of investigation at Jervy&rsquo;s lodgings later in the day. Informed, as
      Phoebe had been informed, that he was not at home, she called again some
      hours afterwards. By that time, the landlord had discovered that Jervy&rsquo;s
      luggage had been secretly conveyed away, and that his tenant had left him,
      in debt for rent of the two best rooms in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      No longer in any doubt of what had happened, Mrs. Sowler employed the
      remaining hours of the evening in making inquiries after the missing man.
      Not a trace of him had been discovered up to eight o&rsquo;clock on the next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;that is to say, towards the hour at which
      Phoebe paid her visit to Amelius&mdash;Mrs. Sowler, resolute to know the
      worst, made her appearance at the apartments occupied by Mrs. Farnaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to speak to you,&rdquo; she began abruptly, &ldquo;about that young man we
      both know of. Have you seen anything of him lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby, steadily on her guard, deferred answering the question. &ldquo;Why
      do you want to know?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply was instantly ready. &ldquo;Because I have reason to believe he has
      bolted, with your money in his pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has done nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he got your money?&rdquo; Mrs. Sowler persisted. &ldquo;Tell me the truth&mdash;and
      I&rsquo;ll do the same by you. He has cheated me. If you&rsquo;re cheated too, it&rsquo;s
      your own interest to lose no time in finding him. The police may catch him
      yet. <i>Has</i> he got your money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman was in earnest&mdash;in terrible earnest&mdash;her eyes and her
      voice both bore witness to it. She stood there, the living impersonation
      of those doubts and fears which Mrs. Farnaby had confessed, in writing to
      Amelius. Her position, at that moment, was essentially a position of
      command. Mrs. Farnaby felt it in spite of herself. She acknowledged that
      Jervy had got the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you sent it to him, or give it to him?&rdquo; Mrs. Sowler asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler clenched her fists, and shook them in impotent rage. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the
      biggest scoundrel living,&rdquo; she exclaimed furiously; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re the
      biggest fool! Put on your bonnet and come to the police. If you get your
      money back again before he&rsquo;s spent it all, don&rsquo;t forget it was through
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The audacity of the woman&rsquo;s language roused Mrs. Farnaby. She pointed to
      the door. &ldquo;You are an insolent creature,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I have nothing more
      to do with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nothing more to do with me?&rdquo; Mrs. Sowler repeated. &ldquo;You and the
      young man have settled it all between you, I suppose.&rdquo; She laughed
      scornfully. &ldquo;I dare say now you expect to see him again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby was irritated into answering this. &ldquo;I expect to see him this
      morning,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the lost young lady with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say nothing about my lost daughter! I won&rsquo;t even hear you speak of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler sat down. &ldquo;Look at your watch,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It must be nigh on
      ten o&rsquo;clock by this time. You&rsquo;ll make a disturbance in the house if you
      try to turn me out. I mean to wait here till ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the point of answering angrily, Mrs. Farnaby restrained herself. &ldquo;You
      are trying to force a quarrel on me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you shan&rsquo;t spoil the
      happiest morning of my life. Wait here by yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door that led into her bedchamber, and shut herself in.
      Perfectly impenetrable to any repulse that could be offered to her, Mrs.
      Sowler looked at the closed door with a sardonic smile, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock in the hall struck ten. Mrs. Farnaby returned again to the
      sitting-room, walked straight to the window, and looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any sign of him?&rdquo; said Mrs. Sowler.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no signs of him. Mrs. Farnaby drew a chair to the window, and
      sat down. Her hands turned icy cold. She still looked out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to guess what&rsquo;s happened,&rdquo; Mrs. Sowler resumed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sociable
      creature, you know, and I must talk about something. About the money, now?
      Has the young man had his travelling expenses of you? To go to foreign
      parts, and bring your girl back with him, eh? I expect that&rsquo;s how it was.
      You see, I know him so well. And what happened, if you please, yesterday
      evening? Did he tell you he&rsquo;d brought her back, and got her at his own
      place? And did he say he wouldn&rsquo;t let you see her till you paid him his
      reward as well as his travelling expenses? And did you forget my warning
      to you not to trust him? I&rsquo;m a good one at guessing when I try. I see you
      think so yourself. Any signs of him yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farnaby looked round from the window. Her manner was completely
      changed; she was nervously civil to the wretch who was torturing her. &ldquo;I
      beg your pardon, ma&rsquo;am, if I have offended you,&rdquo; she said faintly. &ldquo;I am a
      little upset&mdash;I am so anxious about my poor child. Perhaps you are a
      mother yourself? You oughtn&rsquo;t to frighten me; you ought to feel for me.&rdquo;
       She paused, and put her hand to her head. &ldquo;He told me yesterday evening,&rdquo;
       she went on slowly and vacantly, &ldquo;that my poor darling was at his
      lodgings; he said she was so worn out with the long journey from abroad,
      that she must have a night&rsquo;s rest before she could come to me. I asked him
      to tell me where he lived, and let me go to her. He said she was asleep
      and must not be disturbed. I promised to go in on tiptoe, and only look at
      her; I offered him more money, double the money to tell me where she was.
      He was very hard on me. He only said, wait till ten tomorrow morning&mdash;and
      wished me goodnight. I ran out to follow him, and fell on the stairs, and
      hurt myself. The people of the house were very kind to me.&rdquo; She turned her
      head back towards the window, and looked out into the street again. &ldquo;I
      must be patient,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s only a little late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler rose, and tapped her smartly on the shoulder. &ldquo;Lies!&rdquo; she
      burst out. &ldquo;He knows no more where your daughter is than I do&mdash;and
      he&rsquo;s off with your money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s hateful touch struck out a spark of the old fire in Mrs.
      Farnaby. Her natural force of character asserted itself once more. <i>&ldquo;You</i>
      lie!&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;Leave the room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened, while she spoke. A respectable woman-servant came in
      with a letter. Mrs. Farnaby took it mechanically, and looked at the
      address. Jervy&rsquo;s feigned handwriting was familiar to her. In the instant
      when she recognized it, the life seemed to go out of her like an
      extinguished light. She stood pale and still and silent, with the unopened
      letter in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching her with malicious curiosity, Mrs. Sowler coolly possessed
      herself of the letter, looked at it, and recognized the writing in her
      turn. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she cried, as the servant was on the point of going out.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no stamp on this letter. Was it brought by hand? Is the messenger
      waiting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The respectable servant showed her opinion of Mrs. Sowler plainly in her
      face. She replied as briefly and as ungraciously as possible:&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man or woman?&rdquo; was the next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to answer this person, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said the servant, looking at Mrs.
      Farnaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me instantly,&rdquo; Mrs. Sowler interposed&mdash;&ldquo;in Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s own
      interests. Don&rsquo;t you see she can&rsquo;t speak to you herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the servant, &ldquo;it was a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man with a squint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way did he go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Towards the square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowler tossed the letter on the table, and hurried out of the room.
      The servant approached Mrs. Farnaby. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t opened your letter yet,
      ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farnaby vacantly, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t opened it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s bad news, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I think it&rsquo;s bad news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you. Yes; one thing. Open my letter for me, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange request to make. The servant wondered, and obeyed. She
      was a kind-hearted woman; she really felt for the poor lady. But the
      familiar household devil, whose name is Curiosity, and whose opportunities
      are innumerable, prompted her next words when she had taken the letter out
      of the envelope:&mdash;&ldquo;Shall I read it to you, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Put it down on the table, please. I&rsquo;ll ring when I want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother was alone&mdash;alone, with her death-warrant waiting for her
      on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock downstairs struck the half hour after ten. She moved, for the
      first time since she had received the letter. Once more she went to the
      window, and looked out. It was only for a moment. She turned away again,
      with a sudden contempt for herself. &ldquo;What a fool I am!&rdquo; she said&mdash;and
      took up the open letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at it, and put it down again. &ldquo;Why should I read it,&rdquo; she asked
      herself, &ldquo;when I know what is in it, without reading?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some framed woodcuts from the illustrated newspapers were hung on the
      walls. One of them represented a scene of rescue from shipwreck. A mother
      embracing her daughter, saved by the lifeboat, was among the foreground
      groups. The print was entitled, &ldquo;The Mercy of Providence.&rdquo; Mrs. Farnaby
      looked at it with a moment&rsquo;s steady attention. &ldquo;Providence has its
      favourites,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I am not one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After thinking a little, she went into her bedroom, and took two papers
      out of her dressing-case. They were medical prescriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned next to the chimneypiece. Two medicine-bottles were placed on
      it. She took one of them down&mdash;a bottle of the ordinary size, known
      among chemists as a six-ounce bottle. It contained a colourless liquid.
      The label stated the dose to be &ldquo;two table-spoonfuls,&rdquo; and bore, as usual,
      a number corresponding with a number placed on the prescription. She took
      up the prescription. It was a mixture of bi-carbonate of soda and prussic
      acid, intended for the relief of indigestion. She looked at the date, and
      was at once reminded of one of the very rare occasions on which she had
      required the services of a medical man. There had been a serious accident
      at a dinner-party, given by some friends. She had eaten sparingly of a
      certain dish, from which some of the other guests had suffered severely.
      It was discovered that the food had been cooked in an old copper saucepan.
      In her case, the trifling result had been a disturbance of digestion, and
      nothing more. The doctor had prescribed accordingly. She had taken but one
      dose: with her healthy constitution she despised physic. The remainder of
      the mixture was still in the bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      She considered again with herself&mdash;then went back to the
      chimneypiece, and took down the second bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It contained a colourless liquid also; but it was only half the size of
      the first bottle, and not a drop had been taken. She waited, observing the
      difference between the two bottles with extraordinary attention. In this
      case also, the prescription was in her possession&mdash;but it was not the
      original. A line at the top stated that it was a copy made by the chemist,
      at the request of a customer. It bore the date of more than three years
      since. A morsel of paper was pinned to the prescription, containing some
      lines in a woman&rsquo;s handwriting:&mdash;&ldquo;With your enviable health and
      strength, my dear, I should have thought you were the last person in the
      world to want a tonic. However, here is my prescription, if you must have
      it. Be very careful to take the right dose, because there&rsquo;s poison in it.&rdquo;
       The prescription contained three ingredients, strychnine, quinine, and
      nitro-hydrochloric acid; and the dose was fifteen drops in water. Mrs.
      Farnaby lit a match, and burnt the lines of her friend&rsquo;s writing. &ldquo;As long
      ago as that,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;I thought of killing myself. Why didn&rsquo;t I do
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The paper having been destroyed, she put back the prescription for
      indigestion in her dressing-case; hesitated for a moment; and opened the
      bedroom window. It looked into a lonely little courtyard. She threw the
      dangerous contents of the second and smaller bottle out into the yard&mdash;and
      then put it back empty on the chimneypiece. After another moment of
      hesitation, she returned to the sitting-room, with the bottle of mixture,
      and the copied prescription for the tonic strychnine drops, in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the bottle on the table, and advanced to the fireplace to ring the
      bell. Warm as the room was, she began to shiver. Did the eager life in her
      feel the fatal purpose that she was meditating, and shrink from it?
      Instead of ringing the bell, she bent over the fire, trying to warm
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other women would get relief in crying,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I wish I was like
      other women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole sad truth about herself was in that melancholy aspiration. No
      relief in tears, no merciful oblivion in a fainting-fit, for <i>her.</i>
      The terrible strength of the vital organization in this woman knew no
      yielding to the unutterable misery that wrung her to the soul. It roused
      its glorious forces to resist: it held her in a stony quiet, with a grip
      of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away from the fire wondering at herself. &ldquo;What baseness is
      there in me that fears death? What have I got to live for <i>now?&rdquo;</i> The
      open letter on the table caught her eye. &ldquo;This will do it!&rdquo; she said&mdash;and
      snatched it up, and read it at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The least I can do for you is to act like a gentleman, and spare you
      unnecessary suspense. You will not see me this morning at ten, for the
      simple reason that I really don&rsquo;t know, and never did know, where to find
      your daughter. I wish I was rich enough to return the money. Not being
      able to do that, I will give you a word of advice instead. The next time
      you confide any secrets of yours to Mr. Goldenheart, take better care that
      no third person hears you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read those atrocious lines, without any visible disturbance of the
      dreadful composure that possessed her. Her mind made no effort to discover
      the person who had listened and betrayed her. To all ordinary curiosities,
      to all ordinary emotions, she was morally dead already.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one thought in her was a thought that might have occurred to a man.
      &ldquo;If I only had my hands on his throat, how I could wring the life out of
      him! As it is&mdash;&rdquo; Instead of pursuing the reflection, she threw the
      letter into the fire, and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this at once to the nearest chemist&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said, giving the
      strychnine prescription to the servant; &ldquo;and wait, please, and bring it
      back with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her desk, when she was alone, and tore up the letters and
      papers in it. This done, she took her pen, and wrote a letter. It was
      addressed to Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the servant entered the room again, bringing with her the
      prescription made up, the clock downstairs struck eleven.

      CHAPTER 6
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Toff returned to the cottage, with the slippers and the stockings.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a time you have been gone!&rdquo; said Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my fault, sir,&rdquo; Toff explained. &ldquo;The stockings I obtained
      without difficulty. But the nearest shoe shop in this neighbourhood sold
      only coarse manufactures, and all too large. I had to go to my wife, and
      get her to take me to the right place. See!&rdquo; he exclaimed, producing a
      pair of quilted silk slippers with blue rosettes, &ldquo;here is a design, that
      is really worthy of pretty feet. Try them on, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally&rsquo;s eyes sparkled at the sight of the slippers. She rose at once, and
      limped away to her room. Amelius, observing that she still walked in pain,
      called her back. &ldquo;I had forgotten the blister,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Before you put
      on the new stockings, Sally, let me see your foot.&rdquo; He turned to Toff.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always ready with everything,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;I wonder whether you
      have got a needle and a bit of worsted thread?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old Frenchman answered, with an air of respectful reproach. &ldquo;Knowing
      me, sir, as you do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;could you doubt for a moment that I mend my
      own clothes and darn my own stockings?&rdquo; He withdrew to his bedroom below,
      and returned with a leather roll. &ldquo;When you are ready, sir?&rdquo; he said,
      opening the roll at the table, and threading the needle, while Sally
      removed the sock from her left foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a chair near the window, at the suggestion of Amelius. He knelt
      down so as to raise her foot to his knee. &ldquo;Turn a little more towards the
      light,&rdquo; he said. He took the foot in his hand, lifted it, looked at it&mdash;and
      suddenly let it drop back on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry of alarm from Sally instantly brought Toff to the window. &ldquo;Oh,
      look!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s ill!&rdquo; Toff lifted Amelius to a chair. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s
      sake, sir,&rdquo; cried the terrified old man, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Amelius had
      turned to the strange ashy paleness which is only seen in men of his
      florid complexion, overwhelmed by sudden emotion. He stammered when he
      tried to speak. &ldquo;Fetch the brandy!&rdquo; said Toff, pointing to the
      liqueur-case on the sideboard. Sally brought it at once; the strong
      stimulant steadied Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to have frightened you,&rdquo; he said faintly. &ldquo;Sally!&mdash;Dear,
      dear little Sally, go in, and get your things on directly. You must come
      out with me; I&rsquo;ll tell you why afterwards. My God! why didn&rsquo;t I find this
      out before?&rdquo; He noticed Toff, wondering and trembling. &ldquo;Good old fellow!
      don&rsquo;t alarm yourself&mdash;you shall know about it, too. Go! run! get the
      first cab you can find!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left alone for a few minutes, he had time to compose himself. He did his
      best to take advantage of the time; he tried to prepare his mind for the
      coming interview with Mrs. Farnaby. &ldquo;I must be careful of what I do,&rdquo; he
      thought, conscious of the overwhelming effect of the discovery on himself;
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t expect <i>me</i> to bring her daughter to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally returned to him, ready to go out. She seemed to be afraid of him,
      when he approached her, and took her hand. &ldquo;Have I done anything wrong?&rdquo;
       she asked, in her childish way. &ldquo;Are you going to take me to some other
      Home?&rdquo; The tone and look with which she put the question burst through the
      restraints which Amelius had imposed on himself for her sake. &ldquo;My dear
      child!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can you bear a great surprise? I&rsquo;m dying to tell you the
      truth&mdash;and I hardly dare do it.&rdquo; He took her in his arms. She
      trembled piteously. Instead of answering him, she reiterated her question,
      &ldquo;Are you going to take me to some other Home?&rdquo; He could endure it no
      longer. &ldquo;This is the happiest day of your life, Sally!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I am
      going to take you to your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held her close to him, and looked at her in dread of having spoken too
      plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slowly lifted her eyes to him in vacant fear and surprise; she burst
      into no expression of delight; no overwhelming emotion made her sink
      fainting in his arms. The sacred associations which gather round the mere
      name of Mother were associations unknown to her; the man who held her to
      him so tenderly, the hero who had pitied and saved her, was father and
      mother both to her simple mind. She dropped her head on his breast; her
      faltering voice told him that she was crying. &ldquo;Will my mother take me away
      from you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Oh, do promise to bring me back with you to the
      cottage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, and the moment only, Amelius was disappointed in her. The
      generous sympathies in his nature guided him unerringly to the truer view.
      He remembered what her life had been. Inexpressible pity for her filled
      his heart. &ldquo;Oh, my poor Sally, the time is coming when you will not think
      as you think now! I will do nothing to distress you. You mustn&rsquo;t cry&mdash;you
      must be happy, and loving and true to your mother.&rdquo; She dried her eyes,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything you tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as long as you bring me back
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius sighed, and said no more. He took her out with him gravely and
      silently, when the cab was announced to be ready. &ldquo;Double your fare,&rdquo; he
      said, when he gave the driver his instructions, &ldquo;if you get there in a
      quarter of an hour.&rdquo; It wanted twenty-five minutes to twelve when the cab
      left the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, the contrast of feeling between the two could hardly have
      been more strongly marked. In proportion as Amelius became more and more
      agitated, so Sally recovered the composure and confidence that she had
      lost. The first question she put to him related, not to her mother, but to
      his strange behaviour when he had knelt down to look at her foot. He
      answered, explaining to her briefly and plainly what his conduct meant.
      The description of what had passed between her mother and Amelius
      interested and yet perplexed her. &ldquo;How can she be so fond of me, without
      knowing anything about me for all those years?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is my mother a
      lady? Don&rsquo;t tell her where you found me; she might be ashamed of me.&rdquo; She
      paused, and looked at Amelius anxiously. &ldquo;Are you vexed about something?
      May I take hold of your hand?&rdquo; Amelius gave her his hand; and Sally was
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the cab drew up at the house, the door was opened from within. A
      gentleman, dressed in black, hurriedly came out; looked at Amelius; and
      spoke to him as he stepped from the cab to the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir. May I ask if you are any relative of the lady who
      lives in this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No relative,&rdquo; Amelius answered. &ldquo;Only a friend, who brings good news to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger&rsquo;s grave face suddenly became compassionate as well as grave.
      &ldquo;I must speak with you before you go upstairs,&rdquo; he said, lowering his
      voice as he looked at Sally, still seated in the cab. &ldquo;You will perhaps
      excuse the liberty I am taking, when I tell you that I am a medical man.
      Come into the hall for a moment&mdash;and don&rsquo;t bring the young lady with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius told Sally to wait in the cab. She saw his altered looks, and
      entreated him not to leave her. He promised to keep the house door open so
      that she could see him while he was away from her, and hastened into the
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to say I have bad, very bad, news for you,&rdquo; the doctor began.
      &ldquo;Time is of serious importance&mdash;I must speak plainly. You have heard
      of mistakes made by taking the wrong bottle of medicine? The poor lady
      upstairs is, I fear, in a dying state, from an accident of that sort. Try
      to compose yourself. You may really be of use to me, if you are firm
      enough to take my place while I am away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius steadied himself instantly. &ldquo;What I can do, I will do,&rdquo; he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked at him. &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now listen. In this
      case, a dose limited to fifteen drops has been confounded with a dose of
      two table-spoonsful; and the drug taken by mistake is strychnine. One
      grain of the poison has been known to prove fatal&mdash;she has taken
      three. The convulsion fits have begun. Antidotes are out of the question&mdash;the
      poor creature can swallow nothing. I have heard of opium as a possible
      means of relief; and I am going to get the instrument for injecting it
      under the skin. Not that I have much belief in the remedy; but I must try
      something. Have you courage enough to hold her, if another of the
      convulsions comes on in my absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it relieve her, if I hold her?&rdquo; Amelius, asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I promise to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind! you must do it thoroughly. There are only two women upstairs; both
      perfectly useless in this emergency. If she shrieks to you to be held,
      exert your strength&mdash;take her with a firm grasp. If you only touch
      her (I can&rsquo;t explain it, but it is so), you will make matters worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant ran downstairs, while he was speaking. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave us, sir&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      afraid it&rsquo;s coming on again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman will help you, while I am away,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;One
      word more,&rdquo; he went on, addressing Amelius. &ldquo;In the intervals between the
      fits, she is perfectly conscious; able to listen, and even to speak. If
      she has any last wishes to communicate, make good use of the time. She may
      die of exhaustion, at any moment. I will be back directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my cab,&rdquo; said Amelius, &ldquo;and save time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the young lady&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave her to me.&rdquo; He opened the cab door, and gave his hand to Sally. It
      was done in a moment. The doctor drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius saw the servant waiting for them in the hall. He spoke to Sally,
      telling her, considerately and gently, what he had heard, before he took
      her into the house. &ldquo;I had such good hopes for you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and it has
      come to this dreadful end! Have you courage to go through with it, if I
      take you to her bedside? You will be glad one day, my dear, to remember
      that you cheered your mother&rsquo;s last moments on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally put her hand in his. &ldquo;I will go anywhere,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;with
      You.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius led her into the house. The servant, in pity for her youth,
      ventured on a word of remonstrance. &ldquo;Oh, sir, you&rsquo;re not going to let the
      poor young lady see that dreadful sight upstairs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean well,&rdquo; Amelius answered; &ldquo;and I thank you. If you knew what I
      know, you would take her upstairs, too. Show the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally looked at him in silent awe as they followed the servant together.
      He was not like the same man. His brows were knit; his lips were fast set;
      he held the girl&rsquo;s hand in a grip that hurt her. The latent strength of
      will in him&mdash;that reserved resolution, so finely and firmly entwined
      in the natures of sensitively organized men&mdash;was rousing itself to
      meet the coming trial. The doctor would have doubly believed in him, if
      the doctor had seen him at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the first-floor landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the servant could open the drawing-room door, a shriek rang
      frightfully through the silence of the house. The servant drew back, and
      crouched trembling on the upper stairs. At the same moment, the door was
      flung open, and another woman ran out, wild with terror. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear
      it!&rdquo; she cried, and rushed up the stairs, blind to the presence of
      strangers in the panic that possessed her. Amelius entered the
      drawing-room, with his arm round Sally, holding her up. As he placed her
      in a chair, the dreadful cry was renewed. He only waited to rouse and
      encourage her by a word and a look&mdash;and ran into the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant, and an instant only, he stood horror-struck in the
      presence of the poisoned woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fell action of the strychnine wrung every muscle in her with the
      torture of convulsion. Her hands were fast clenched; her head was bent
      back: her body, rigid as a bar of iron, was arched upwards from the bed,
      resting on the two extremities of the head and the heels: the staring
      eyes, the dusky face, the twisted lips, the clenched teeth, were frightful
      to see. He faced it. After the one instant of hesitation, he faced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she could cry out again, his hands were on her. The whole exertion
      of his strength was barely enough to keep the frenzied throbs of the
      convulsion, as it reached its climax, from throwing her off the bed.
      Through the worst of it, he was still equal to the trust that had been
      placed in him, still faithful to the work of mercy. Little by little, he
      felt the lessening resistance of the rigid body, as the paroxysm began to
      subside. He saw the ghastly stare die out of her eyes, and the twisted
      lips relax from their dreadful grin. The tortured body sank, and rested;
      the perspiration broke out on her face; her languid hands fell gently over
      on the bed. For a while, the heavy eyelids closed&mdash;then opened again
      feebly. She looked at him. &ldquo;Do you know me?&rdquo; he asked, bending over her.
      And she answered in a faint whisper, &ldquo;Amelius!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt down by her, and kissed her hand. &ldquo;Can you listen, if I tell you
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She breathed heavily; her bosom heaved under the suffocating oppression
      that weighed upon it. As he took her in his arms to raise her in the bed,
      Sally&rsquo;s voice reached him, in low imploring tones, from the next room.
      &ldquo;Oh, let me come to you! I&rsquo;m so frightened here by myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited, before he told her to come in, looking for a moment at the face
      that was resting on his breast. A gray shadow was stealing over it; a cold
      and clammy moisture struck a chill through him as he put his hand on her
      forehead. He turned towards the next room. The girl had ventured as far as
      the door; he beckoned to her. She came in timidly, and stood by him, and
      looked at her mother. Amelius signed to her to take his place. &ldquo;Put your
      arms round her,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Oh, Sally, tell her who you are in a
      kiss!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s tears fell fast as she pressed her lips on her mother&rsquo;s
      cheek. The dying woman looked at her, with a glance of helpless inquiry&mdash;then
      looked at Amelius. The doubt in her eyes was too dreadful to be endured.
      Arranging the pillows so that she could keep her raised position in the
      bed, he signed to Sally to approach him, and removed the slipper from her
      left foot. As he took it off, he looked again at the bed&mdash;looked and
      shuddered. In a moment more, it might be too late. With his knife he
      ripped up the stocking, and, lifting her on the bed, put her bare foot on
      her mother&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;Your child! your child!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found your own
      darling! For God&rsquo;s sake, rouse yourself! Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard him. She lifted her feebly declining head. She looked. She knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one awful moment, the sinking vital forces rallied, and hurled back
      the hold of Death. Her eyes shone radiant with the divine light of
      maternal love; an exulting cry of rapture burst from her. Slowly, very
      slowly, she bent forward, until her face rested on her daughter&rsquo;s foot.
      With a faint sigh of ecstasy she kissed it. The moments passed&mdash;and
      the bent head was raised no more. The last beat of the heart was a beat of
      joy.

      CHAPTER 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day which had united the mother and daughter, only to part them again
      in this world for ever, had advanced to evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius and Sally were together again in the cottage, sitting by the
      library fire. The silence in the room was uninterrupted. On the open desk,
      near Amelius, lay the letter which Mrs. Farnaby had written to him on the
      morning of her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had found the letter&mdash;with the envelope unfastened&mdash;on the
      floor of the bedchamber, and had fortunately secured it before the
      landlady and the servant had ventured back to the room. The doctor,
      returning a few minutes afterwards, had warned the two women that a
      coroner&rsquo;s inquest would be held in the house, and had vainly cautioned
      them to be careful of what they said or did in the interval. Not only the
      subject of the death, but a discovery which had followed, revealing the
      name of the ill-fated woman marked on her linen, and showing that she had
      used an assumed name in taking the lodgings as Mrs. Ronald, became the
      gossip of the neighbourhood in a few hours. Under these circumstances, the
      catastrophe was made the subject of a paragraph in the evening journals;
      the name being added for the information of any surviving relatives who
      might be ignorant of the sad event. If the landlady had found the letter,
      that circumstance also would in all probability, have formed part of the
      statement in the newspapers, and the secret of Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s life and
      death would have been revealed to the public view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can trust you, and you only,&rdquo; she wrote to Amelius, &ldquo;to fulfil the last
      wishes of a dying woman. You know me, and you know how I looked forward to
      the prospect of a happy life in retirement with my child. The one hope
      that I lived for has proved to be a cruel delusion. I have only this
      morning discovered, beyond the possibility of doubt, that I have been made
      the victim of wretches who have deliberately lied to me from first to
      last. If I had been a happier woman, I might have had other interests to
      sustain me under this frightful disaster. Such as I am, Death is my one
      refuge left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My suicide will be known to no creature but yourself. Some years since,
      the idea of self destruction&mdash;concealed under the disguise of a
      common mistake&mdash;presented itself to my mind. I kept the means, very
      simple means, by me, thinking I might end in that way after all. When you
      read this I shall be at rest for ever. You will do what I have yet to ask
      of you, in merciful remembrance of me&mdash;I am sure of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a long life before you, Amelius. My foolish fancy about you and
      my lost girl still lingers in my mind; I still think it may be just
      possible that you may meet with her, in the course of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this does happen, I implore you, by the tenderness and pity that you
      once felt for me, to tell no human creature that she is my daughter; and,
      if John Farnaby is living at the time, I forbid you, with the authority of
      a dying friend, to let her see him, or to let her know even that such a
      person exists. Are you at a loss to account for my motives? I may make the
      shameful confession which will enlighten you, now I know that we shall
      never meet again. My child was born before my marriage; and the man who
      afterwards became my husband&mdash;a man of low origin, I should tell you&mdash;was
      the father. He had calculated on this disgraceful circumstance to force my
      parents to make his fortune, by making me his wife. I now know, what I
      only vaguely suspected before, that he deliberately abandoned his child,
      as a likely cause of hindrance and scandal in the way of his prosperous
      career in life. Do you now think I am asking too much, when I entreat you
      never even to speak to my lost darling of this unnatural wretch? As for my
      own fair fame, I am not thinking of myself. With Death close at my side, I
      think of my poor mother, and of all that she suffered and sacrificed to
      save me from the disgrace that I had deserved. For her sake, not for mine,
      keep silence to friends and enemies alike if they ask you who my girl is&mdash;with
      the one exception of my lawyer. Years since, I left in his care the means
      of making a small provision for my child, on the chance that she might
      live to claim it. You can show him this letter as your authority, in case
      of need.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try not to forget me, Amelius&mdash;but don&rsquo;t grieve about me. I go to my
      death as you go to your sleep when you are tired. I leave you my grateful
      love&mdash;you have always been good to me. There is no more to write; I
      hear the servant returning from the chemist&rsquo;s, bringing with her only
      release from the hard burden of life without hope. May you be happier than
      I have been! Goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she parted from him for ever. But the fatal association of the unhappy
      woman&rsquo;s sorrows with the life and fortune of Amelius was not at an end
      yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had neither hesitation nor misgiving in resolving to show a natural
      respect to the wishes of the dead. Now that the miserable story of the
      past had been unreservedly disclosed to him, he would have felt himself
      bound in honour, even without instructions to guide him, to keep the
      discovery of the daughter a secret, for the mother&rsquo;s sake. With that
      conviction, he had read the distressing letter. With that conviction, he
      now rose to provide for the safe keeping of it under lock and key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he had secured the letter in a private drawer of his desk, Toff
      came in with a card, and announced that a gentleman wished to see him.
      Amelius, looking at the card, was surprised to find on it the name of &ldquo;Mr.
      Melton.&rdquo; Some lines were written on it in pencil: &ldquo;I have called to speak
      with you on a matter of serious importance.&rdquo; Wondering what his
      middle-aged rival could want with him, Amelius instructed Toff to admit
      the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally started to her feet, with her customary distrust of strangers. &ldquo;May
      I run away before he comes in?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; Amelius answered
      quietly. She ran to the door of her room, at the moment when Toff appeared
      again, announcing the visitor. Mr. Melton entered just before she
      disappeared: he saw the flutter of her dress as the door closed behind
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I am disturbing you?&rdquo; he said, looking hard at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was perfectly dressed: his hat and gloves were models of what such
      things ought to be; he was melancholy and courteous; blandly distrustful
      of the flying skirts which he had seen at the door. When Amelius offered
      him a chair, he took it with a mysterious sigh; mournfully resigned to the
      sad necessity of sitting down. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t prolong my intrusion on you,&rdquo; he
      resumed. &ldquo;You have no doubt seen the melancholy news in the evening
      papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen the evening papers,&rdquo; Amelius answered; &ldquo;what news do you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Melton leaned back in his chair, and expressed emotions of sorrow and
      surprise, in a perfect state of training, by gently raising his smooth
      white hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, dear! this is very sad. I had hoped to find you in full
      possession of the particulars&mdash;reconciled, as we must all be, to the
      inscrutable ways of Providence. Permit me to break it to you as gently as
      possible. I came here to inquire if you had heard yet from Miss Regina.
      Understand my motive! there must be no misapprehension between us on that
      subject. There is a very serious necessity&mdash;pray follow me carefully&mdash;I
      say, a very serious necessity for my communicating immediately with Miss
      Regina&rsquo;s uncle; and I know of nobody who is so likely to hear from the
      travellers, so soon after their departure, as yourself. You are, in a
      certain sense, a member of the family&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; said Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo; said Mr. Melton politely, at a loss to understand the
      interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t at first know what you meant,&rdquo; Amelius explained. &ldquo;You put it,
      if you will forgive me for saying so, in rather a roundabout way. If you
      are alluding, all this time, to Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s death, I must honestly tell
      you that I know of it already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bland self-possession of Mr. Melton&rsquo;s face began to show signs of
      being ruffled. He had been in a manner deluded into exhibiting his
      conventionally fluent eloquence, in the choicest modulations of his
      sonorous voice&mdash;and it wounded his self esteem to be placed in his
      present position. &ldquo;I understood you to say,&rdquo; he remarked stiffly, &ldquo;that
      you had not seen the evening newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; Amelius rejoined; &ldquo;I have not seen them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then may I inquire,&rdquo; Mr. Melton proceeded, &ldquo;how you became informed of
      Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius replied with his customary frankness. &ldquo;I went to call on the poor
      lady this morning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;knowing nothing of what had happened. I met
      the doctor at the door; and I was present at her death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Mr. Melton&rsquo;s carefully-trained composure was not proof against the
      revelation that now opened before him. He burst out with an exclamation of
      astonishment, like an ordinary man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, what does this mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius took it as a question addressed to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
      know,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Melton, misunderstanding Amelius on his side, interpreted those
      innocent words as an outbreak of vulgar interruption. &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said
      coldly. &ldquo;I was about to explain myself. You will presently understand my
      surprise. After seeing the evening paper, I went at once to make inquiries
      at the address mentioned. In Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s absence, I felt bound to do
      this as his old friend. I saw the landlady, and, with her assistance, the
      doctor also. Both these persons spoke of a gentleman who had called that
      morning, accompanied by a young lady; and who had insisted on taking the
      young lady upstairs with him. Until you mentioned just now that you were
      present at the death, I had no suspicion that you were &lsquo;the gentleman&rsquo;.
      Surprise on my part was, I think, only natural. I could hardly be expected
      to know that you were in Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s confidence about the place of her
      retreat. And with regard to the young lady, I am still quite at a loss to
      understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you understand that the people at the house told you the truth, so far
      as I am concerned,&rdquo; Amelius interposed, &ldquo;I hope that will be enough. With
      regard to the young lady, I must beg you to excuse me for speaking
      plainly. I have nothing to say about her, to you or to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Melton rose with the utmost dignity and the fullest possession of his
      vocal resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to assure you,&rdquo; he said, with frigidly fluent politeness, &ldquo;that
      I have no wish to force myself into your confidence. One remark I will
      venture to make. It is easy enough, no doubt, to keep your own secrets,
      when you are speaking to <i>me.</i> You will find some difficulty, I fear,
      in pursuing the same course, when you are called upon to give evidence
      before the coroner. I presume you know that you will be summoned as a
      witness at the inquest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left my name and address with the doctor for that purpose,&rdquo; Amelius
      rejoined as composedly as ever; &ldquo;and I am ready to bear witness to what I
      saw at poor Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s bedside. But if all the coroners in England
      questioned me about anything else, I should say to them just what I have
      said to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Melton smiled with well bred irony. &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the
      mean time, I presume I may ask you, in the interests of the family, to
      send me the address on the letter, as soon as you hear from Miss Regina. I
      have no other means of communicating with Mr. Farnaby. In respect to the
      melancholy event, I may add that I have undertaken to provide for the
      funeral, and to pay any little outstanding debts, and so forth. As Mr.
      Farnaby&rsquo;s old friend and representative&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion of the sentence was interrupted by the entrance of Toff
      with a note, and an apology for his intrusion. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir;
      the person is waiting. She says it&rsquo;s only a receipt to sign. The box is in
      the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius examined the enclosure. It was a formal document, acknowledging
      the receipt of Sally&rsquo;s clothes, returned to her by the authorities at the
      Home. As he took a pen to sign the receipt he looked towards the door of
      Sally&rsquo;s room. Mr. Melton, observing the look, prepared to retire. &ldquo;I am
      only interrupting you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have my address on my card. Good
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his way out, he passed an elderly woman, waiting in the hall. Toff,
      hastening before him to open the garden gate, was saluted by the gruff
      voice of a cabman, outside. &ldquo;The lady whom he had driven to the cottage
      had not paid him his right fare; he meant to have the money, or the lady&rsquo;s
      name and address, and summon her.&rdquo; Quietly crossing the road, Mr. Melton
      heard the woman&rsquo;s voice next: she had got her receipt, and had followed
      him out. In the dispute about fares and distances that ensued, the
      contending parties more than once mentioned the name of the Home and of
      the locality in which it was situated. Possessing this information, Mr.
      Melton looked in at his club; consulted a directory, under the heading of
      &ldquo;Charitable Institutions;&rdquo; and solved the mystery of the vanishing
      petticoats at the door. He had discovered an inmate of an asylum for lost
      women, in the house of the man to whom Regina was engaged to be married!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning&rsquo;s post brought to Amelius a letter from Regina. It was
      dated from an hotel in Paris. Her &ldquo;dear uncle&rdquo; had over estimated his
      strength. He had refused to stay and rest for the night at Boulogne; and
      had suffered so severely from the fatigue of the long journey that he had
      been confined to his bed since his arrival. The English physician
      consulted had declined to say when he would be strong enough to travel
      again; the constitution of the patient must have received some serious
      shock; he was brought very low. Having carefully reported the new medical
      opinion, Regina was at liberty to indulge herself, next, in expressions of
      affection, and to assure Amelius of her anxiety to hear from him as soon
      as possible. But, in this case again, the &ldquo;dear uncle&rsquo;s&rdquo; convenience was
      still the first consideration. She reverted to Mr. Farnaby, in making her
      excuses for a hurriedly written letter. The poor invalid suffered from
      depression of spirits; his great consolation in his illness was to hear
      his niece read to him: he was calling for her, indeed, at that moment. The
      inevitable postscript warmed into a mild effusion of fondness, &ldquo;How I wish
      you could be with us. But, alas, it cannot be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius copied the address on the letter, and sent it to Mr. Melton
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then the twenty-fourth day of the month. The tidal train did not
      leave London early that morning; and the inquest was deferred, to suit
      other pressing engagements of the coroner, until the twenty-sixth. Mr.
      Melton decided, after his interview with Amelius, that the emergency was
      sufficiently serious to justify him in following his telegram to Paris. It
      was clearly his duty, as an old friend, to mention to Mr. Farnaby what he
      had discovered at the cottage, as well as what he had heard from the
      landlady and the doctor; leaving it to the uncle&rsquo;s discretion to act as he
      thought right in the interests of the niece. Whether that course of action
      might not also serve the interests of Mr. Melton himself, in the character
      of an unsuccessful suitor for Regina&rsquo;s hand, he did not stop to inquire.
      Beyond his duty it was, for the present at least, not his business to
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, the two gentlemen held a private consultation in Paris; the
      doctor having previously certified that his patient was incapable of
      supporting the journey back to London, under any circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of the formal proceedings rendered necessary by Mrs.
      Farnaby&rsquo;s death having been discussed and disposed of, Mr. Melton next
      entered on the narrative which the obligations of friendship imperatively
      demanded from him. To his astonishment and alarm, Mr. Farnaby started up
      in the bed like a man panic-stricken. &ldquo;Did you say,&rdquo; he stammered, as soon
      as he could speak, &ldquo;you mean to make inquiries about that&mdash;that
      girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly thought it desirable, bearing in mind Mr. Goldenheart&rsquo;s
      position in your family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do nothing of the sort! Say nothing to Regina or to any living creature.
      Wait till I get well again&mdash;and leave me to deal with it. I am the
      proper person to take it in hand. Don&rsquo;t you see that for yourself? And,
      look here! there may be questions asked at the inquest. Some impudent
      scoundrel on the jury may want to pry into what doesn&rsquo;t concern him. The
      moment you&rsquo;re back in London, get a lawyer to represent us&mdash;the
      sharpest fellow that can be had for money. Tell him to stop all prying
      questions. Who the girl is, and what made that cursed young Socialist
      Goldenheart take her upstairs with him&mdash;all that sort of thing has
      nothing to do with the manner in which my wife met her death. You
      understand? I look to you, Melton, to see yourself that this is done. The
      less said at the infernal inquest, the better. In my position, it&rsquo;s an
      exposure that my enemies will make the most of, as it is. I&rsquo;m too ill to
      go into the thing any further. No: I don&rsquo;t want Regina. Go to her in the
      sitting room, and tell the courier to get you something to eat and drink.
      And, I say! For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t be late for the Boulogne train tomorrow
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left by himself, he gave full vent to his fury; he cursed Amelius with
      oaths that are not to be written.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had burnt the letter which Mrs. Farnaby had written to him, on leaving
      him forever; but he had not burnt out of his memory the words which that
      letter contained. With his wife&rsquo;s language vividly present to his mind, he
      could arrive at but one conclusion, after what Mr. Melton had told him.
      Amelius was concerned in the discovery of his deserted daughter; Amelius
      had taken the girl to her dying mother&rsquo;s bedside. With his idiotic
      Socialist notions, he would be perfectly capable of owning the truth, if
      inquiries were made. The unblemished reputation which John Farnaby had
      built up by the self-seeking hypocrisy of a lifetime was at the mercy of a
      visionary young fool, who believed that rich men were created for the
      benefit of the poor, and who proposed to regenerate society by reviving
      the obsolete morality of the Primitive Christians. Was it possible for him
      to come to terms with such a person as this? There was not an inch of
      common ground on which they could meet. He dropped back on his pillow in
      despair, and lay for a while frowning and biting his nails. Suddenly he
      sat up again in the bed, and wiped his moist forehead, and heaved a heavy
      breath of relief. Had his illness obscured his intelligence? How was it he
      had not seen at once the perfectly easy way out of the difficulty which
      was presented by the facts themselves? Here is a man, engaged to marry my
      niece, who has been discovered keeping a girl at his cottage&mdash;who
      even had the audacity to take her upstairs with him when he made a call on
      my wife. Charge him with it in plain words; break off the engagement
      publicly in the face of society; and, if the profligate scoundrel tries to
      defend himself by telling the truth, who will believe him&mdash;when the
      girl was seen running out of his room? and when he refused, on the
      question being put to him, to say who she was?
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in ignorance of his wife&rsquo;s last instructions to Amelius&mdash;in equal
      ignorance of the compassionate silence which an honourable man preserves
      when a woman&rsquo;s reputation is at his mercy&mdash;the wretch needlessly
      plotted and planned to save his usurped reputation; seeing all things, as
      such men invariably do, through the foul light of his own inbred baseness
      and cruelty. He was troubled by no retributive emotions of shame or
      remorse, in contemplating this second sacrifice to his own interests of
      the daughter whom he had deserted in her infancy. If he felt any
      misgivings, they related wholly to himself. His head was throbbing, his
      tongue was dry; a dread of increasing his illness shook him suddenly. He
      drank some of the lemonade at his bedside, and lay down to compose himself
      to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not to be done; there was a burning in his eyeballs, there was a
      wild irregular beating at his heart, which kept him awake. In some degree,
      at least, retribution seemed to be on the way to him already.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Melton, delicately administering sympathy and consolation to Regina&mdash;whose
      affectionate nature felt keenly the calamity of her aunt&rsquo;s death&mdash;Mr.
      Melton, making himself modestly useful, by reading aloud certain
      devotional poems much prized by Regina, was called out of the room by the
      courier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just looked in at Mr. Farnaby, sir,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;and I am
      afraid he is worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician was sent for. He thought so seriously of the change in the
      patient, that he obliged Regina to accept the services of a professed
      nurse. When Mr. Melton started on his return journey the next morning, he
      left his friend in a high fever.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      The inquiry into the circumstances under which Mrs. Farnaby had died was
      held in the forenoon of the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Melton surprised Amelius by calling for him, and taking him to the
      inquest. The carriage stopped on the way, and a gentleman joined them, who
      was introduced as Mr. Melton&rsquo;s legal adviser. He spoke to Amelius about
      the inquest; stating, as his excuse for asking certain discreet questions,
      that his object was to suppress any painful disclosures. On reaching the
      house, Mr. Melton and his lawyer said a few words to the coroner
      downstairs, while the jury were assembling on the floor above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first witness examined was the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      After deposing to the date at which the late Mrs. Farnaby had hired her
      lodgings, and verifying the statements which had appeared in the
      newspapers, she was questioned about the life and habits of the deceased.
      She described her late lodger as a respectable lady, punctual in her
      payments, and quiet and orderly in her way of life: she received letters,
      but saw no friends. On several occasions, an old woman was admitted to
      speak with her; and these visits seemed to be anything but agreeable to
      the deceased. Asked if she knew anything of the old woman, or of what had
      passed at the interviews described, the witness answered both questions in
      the negative. When the woman called, she always told the servant to
      announce her as &ldquo;the nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Melton was next examined, to prove the identity of the deceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      He declared that he was quite unable to explain why she had left her
      husband&rsquo;s house under an assumed name. Asked if Mr. and Mrs. Farnaby had
      lived together on affectionate terms, he acknowledged that he had heard,
      at various times, of a want of harmony between them, but was not
      acquainted with the cause. Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s high character and position in
      the commercial world spoke for themselves: the restraints of a gentleman
      guided him in his relations with his wife. The medical certificate of his
      illness in Paris was then put in; and Mr. Melton&rsquo;s examination came to an
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chemist who had made up the prescription was the third witness. He
      knew the woman who brought it to his shop to be in the service of the
      first witness examined; an old customer of his, and a highly respected
      resident in the neighbourhood. He made up all prescriptions himself in
      which poisons were conspicuous ingredients; and he had affixed to the
      bottle a slip of paper, bearing the word &ldquo;Poison,&rdquo; printed in large
      letters. The bottle was produced and identified; and the directions in the
      prescription were shown to have been accurately copied on the label.
    </p>
    <p>
      A general sensation of interest was excited by the appearance of the next
      witness&mdash;the woman servant. It was anticipated that her evidence
      would explain how the fatal mistake about the medicine had occurred. After
      replying to the formal inquiries, she proceeded as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I answered the bell, at the time I have mentioned, I found the
      deceased standing at the fireplace. There was a bottle of medicine on the
      table, by her writing desk. It was a much larger bottle than that which
      the last witness identified, and it was more than three parts full of some
      colourless medicine. The deceased gave me a prescription to take to the
      chemist&rsquo;s, with instructions to wait, and bring back the physic. She said,
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel at all well this morning; I thought of trying some of this
      medicine,&rsquo; pointing to the bottle by her desk; &lsquo;but I am not sure it is
      the right thing for me. I think I want a tonic. The prescription I have
      given you is a tonic.&rsquo; I went out at once to our chemist and got it. I
      found her writing a letter when I came back, but she finished it
      immediately, and pushed it away from her. When I put the bottle I had
      brought from the chemist on the table, she looked at the other larger
      bottle which she had by her; and she said, &lsquo;You will think me very
      undecided; I have been doubting, since I sent you to the chemist, whether
      I had not better begin with this medicine here, before I try the tonic.
      It&rsquo;s a medicine for the stomach; and I fancy it&rsquo;s only indigestion that&rsquo;s
      the matter with me, after all.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;You eat but a poor breakfast,
      ma&rsquo;am, this morning. It isn&rsquo;t for me to advise; but, as you seem to be in
      doubt about yourself, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to send for a doctor?&rsquo; She
      shook her head, and said she didn&rsquo;t want to have a doctor if she could
      possibly help it. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try the medicine for indigestion first,&rsquo; she says;
      &lsquo;and if it doesn&rsquo;t relieve me, we will see what is to be done, later in
      the day.&rsquo; While we were talking, the tonic was left in its sealed paper
      cover, just as I had brought it from the shop. She took up the bottle
      containing the stomach medicine, and read the directions on it: &lsquo;Two
      tablespoonsful by measure-glass twice a day.&rsquo; I asked if she had a
      measure-glass; and she said, Yes, and sent me to her bedroom to look for
      it. I couldn&rsquo;t find it. While I was looking, I heard her cry out, and ran
      back to the drawing-room to see what was the matter. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;how
      clumsy I am! I&rsquo;ve broken the bottle.&rsquo; She held up the bottle of the
      stomach medicine and showed it to me, broken just below the neck. &lsquo;Go back
      to the bedroom,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and see if you can find an empty bottle; I
      don&rsquo;t want to waste the medicine if I can help it.&rsquo; There was only one
      empty bottle in the bedroom, a bottle on the chimney-piece. I took it to
      her immediately. She gave me the broken bottle; and while I poured the
      medicine into the bottle which I had found in the bedroom, she opened the
      paper which covered the tonic I had brought from the chemist. When I had
      done, and the two bottles were together on the table&mdash;the bottle that
      I had filled, and the bottle that I had brought front the chemist&mdash;I
      noticed that they were both of the same size, and that both had a label
      pasted on them, marked &lsquo;Poison.&rsquo; I said to her, &lsquo;You must take care,
      ma&rsquo;am, you don&rsquo;t make any mistake, the two bottles are so exactly alike.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;I can easily prevent that,&rsquo; she says, and dipped her pen in the ink, and
      copied the directions on the broken bottle, on to the label of the bottle
      that I had just filled. &lsquo;There!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Now I hope your mind&rsquo;s at
      ease?&rsquo; She spoke cheerfully, as if she was joking with me. And then she
      said, &lsquo;But where&rsquo;s the measure-glass?&rsquo; I went back to the bedroom to look
      for it, and couldn&rsquo;t find it again. She changed all at once, upon that&mdash;she
      became quite angry; and walked up and down in a fume, abusing me for my
      stupidity. It was very unlike her. On all other occasions she was a most
      considerate lady. I made allowances for her. She had been very much upset
      earlier in the morning, when she had received a letter, which she told me
      herself contained bad news. Yes; another person was present at the time&mdash;the
      same woman that my mistress told you of. The woman looked at the address
      on the letter, and seemed to know who it was from. I told her a
      squint-eyed man had brought it to the house&mdash;and then she left
      directly. I don&rsquo;t know where she went, or the address at which she lives,
      or who the messenger was who brought the letter. As I have said, I made
      allowances for the deceased lady. I went downstairs, without answering,
      and got a tumbler and a tablespoon to serve instead of the measure-glass.
      When I came back with the things, she was still walking about in a temper.
      She took no notice of me. I left the room again quietly, seeing she was
      not in a state to be spoken to. I saw nothing more of her, until we were
      alarmed by hearing her scream. We found the poor lady on the floor in a
      kind of fit. I ran out and fetched the nearest doctor. This is the whole
      truth, on my oath; and this is all I know about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlady was recalled at the request of the jury, and questioned again
      about the old woman. She could give no information. Being asked next if
      any letters or papers belonging to, or written by, the deceased lady had
      been found, she declared that, after the strictest search, nothing had
      been discovered but two medical prescriptions. The writing desk was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was the next witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He described the state in which he found the patient, on being called to
      the house. The symptoms were those of poisoning by strychnine. Examination
      of the prescriptions and the bottles, aided by the servant&rsquo;s information,
      convinced him that a fatal mistake had been made by the deceased; the
      nature of which he explained to the jury as he had already explained it to
      Amelius. Having mentioned the meeting with Amelius at the house-door, and
      the events which had followed, he closed his evidence by stating the
      result of the postmortem examination, proving that the death was caused by
      the poison called strychnine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady and the servant were examined again. They were instructed to
      inform the jury exactly of the time that had elapsed, from the moment when
      the servant had left the deceased alone in the drawing-room, to the time
      when the screams were first heard. Having both given the same evidence, on
      this point, they were next asked whether any person, besides the old
      woman, had visited the deceased lady&mdash;or had on any pretence obtained
      access to her in the interval. Both swore positively that there had not
      even been a knock at the house-door in the interval, and that the
      area-gate was locked, and the key in the possession of the landlady. This
      evidence placed it beyond the possibility of doubt that the deceased had
      herself taken the poison. The question whether she had taken it by
      accident was the only question left to decide, when Amelius was called as
      the next witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer retained by Mr. Melton, to watch the case on behalf of Mr.
      Farnaby, had hitherto not interfered. It was observed that he paid the
      closest attention to the inquiry, at the stage which it had now reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius was nervous at the outset. The early training in America, which
      had hardened him to face an audience and speak with self-possession on
      social and political subjects had not prepared him for the very difficult
      ordeal of a first appearance as a witness. Having answered the customary
      inquiries, he was so painfully agitated in describing Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s
      sufferings, that the coroner suspended the examination for a few minutes,
      to give him time to control himself. He failed, however, to recover his
      composure, until the narrative part of his evidence had come to an end.
      When the critical questions, bearing on his relations with Mrs. Farnaby,
      began, the audience noticed that he lifted his head, and looked and spoke,
      for the first time, like a man with a settled resolution in him, sure of
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The questions proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he in Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s confidence, on the subject of her domestic
      differences with her husband? Did those differences lead to her
      withdrawing herself from her husband&rsquo;s roof? Did Mrs. Farnaby inform him
      of the place of her retreat? To these three questions the witness,
      speaking quite readily in each case, answered Yes. Asked next, what the
      nature of the &lsquo;domestic differences&rsquo; had been; whether they were likely to
      affect Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s mind seriously; why she had passed under an assumed
      name, and why she had confided the troubles of her married life to a young
      man like himself, only introduced to her a few months since, the witness
      simply declined to reply to the inquiries addressed to him. &ldquo;The
      confidence Mrs. Farnaby placed in me,&rdquo; he said to the coroner, &ldquo;was a
      confidence which I gave her my word of honour to respect. When I have said
      that, I hope the jury will understand that I owe it to the memory of the
      dead to say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a murmur of approval among the audience, instantly checked by
      the coroner. The foreman of the jury rose, and remarked that scruples of
      honour were out of place at a serious inquiry of that sort. Hearing this,
      the lawyer saw his opportunity, and got on his legs. &ldquo;I represent the
      husband of the deceased lady,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr. Goldenheart has appealed to
      the law of honour to justify him in keeping silence. I am astonished that
      there is a man to be found in this assembly who fails to sympathize with
      him. But as there appears to be such a person present, I ask permission,
      sir, to put a question to the witness. It may, or may not, satisfy the
      foreman of the jury; but it will certainly assist the object of the
      present inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coroner, after a glance at Mr. Melton, permitted the lawyer to put his
      question in these terms:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your knowledge of Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s domestic troubles give you any
      reason to apprehend that they might urge her to commit suicide?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Amelius answered. &ldquo;When I called on her, on the morning
      of her death, I had no apprehension whatever of her committing suicide. I
      went to the house as the bearer of good news; and I said so to the doctor,
      when he first spoke to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor confirmed this. The foreman was silenced, if not convinced. One
      of his brother-jurymen, however, feeling the force of example, interrupted
      the proceedings, by assailing Amelius with another question:&mdash;&ldquo;We
      have heard that you were accompanied by a young lady at the time you have
      mentioned, and that you took her upstairs with you. We want to know what
      business the young lady had in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer interfered again. &ldquo;I object to that question,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
      purpose of the inquest is to ascertain how Mrs. Farnaby met with her
      death. What has the young lady to do with it? The doctor&rsquo;s evidence has
      already told us that she was not at the house, until after he had been
      called in, and the deadly action of the poison had begun. I appeal, sir,
      to the law of evidence, and to you, as the presiding authority, to enforce
      it. Mr. Goldenheart, who is acquainted with the circumstances of the
      deceased lady&rsquo;s life, has declared on his oath that there was nothing in
      those circumstances to inspire him with any apprehension of her committing
      suicide. The evidence of the servant at the lodgings points plainly to the
      conclusion already arrived at by the medical witness, that the death was
      the result of a lamentable mistake, and of that alone. Is our time to be
      wasted in irrelevant questions, and are the feelings of the surviving
      relatives to be cruelly lacerated to no purpose, to satisfy the curiosity
      of strangers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strong expression of approval from the audience followed this. The
      lawyer whispered to Mr. Melton, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Order being restored, the coroner ruled that the juryman&rsquo;s question was
      not admissible, and that the servant&rsquo;s evidence, taken with the statements
      of the doctor and the chemist, was the only evidence for the consideration
      of the jury. Summing up to this effect, he recalled Amelius, at the
      request of the foreman, to inquire if the witness knew anything of the old
      woman who had been frequently alluded to in the course of the proceedings.
      Amelius could answer this question as honestly as he had answered the
      questions preceding it. He neither knew the woman&rsquo;s name, nor where she
      was to be found. The coroner inquired, with a touch of irony, if the jury
      wished the inquest to be adjourned, under existing circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of appearances, the jury consulted together. But the
      luncheon-hour was approaching; the servant&rsquo;s evidence was undeniably clear
      and conclusive; the coroner, in summing up, had requested them not to
      forget that the deceased had lost her temper with the servant, and that an
      angry woman might well make a mistake which would be unlikely in her
      cooler moments. All these influences led the jury irrepressibly, over the
      obstacles of obstinacy, on the way to submission. After a needless delay,
      they returned a verdict of &ldquo;death by misadventure.&rdquo; The secret of Mrs.
      Farnaby&rsquo;s suicide remained inviolate; the reputation of her vile husband
      stood as high as ever; and the future life of Amelius was, from that fatal
      moment, turned irrevocably into a new course.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the conclusion of the proceedings, Mr. Melton, having no further need
      of Amelius or the lawyer, drove away by himself. But he was too
      inveterately polite to omit making his excuses for leaving them in a
      hurry; he expected, he said, to find a telegram from Paris waiting at his
      house. Amelius only delayed his departure to ask the landlady if the day
      of the funeral was settled. Hearing that it was arranged for the next
      morning, he thanked her, and returned at once to the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally was waiting his arrival to complete some purchases of mourning for
      her unhappy mother; Toff&rsquo;s wife being in attendance to take care of her.
      She was curious to know how the inquest had ended. In answering her
      question, Amelius was careful to warn her, if her companion made any
      inquiries, only to say that she had lost her mother under very sad
      circumstances. The two having left the cottage, he instructed Toff to let
      in a stranger, who was to call by previous appointment, and to close the
      door to every one else. In a few minutes, the expected person, a young
      man, who gave the name of Morcross, made his appearance, and sorely
      puzzled the old Frenchman. He was well dressed; his manner was quiet and
      self-possessed&mdash;and yet he did not look like a gentleman. In fact, he
      was a policeman of the higher order, in plain clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being introduced to the library, he spread out on the table some sheets of
      manuscript, in the handwriting of Amelius, with notes in red ink on the
      margin, made by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, sir,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that you have reasons for not bringing
      this case to trial in a court of law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to say,&rdquo; Amelius answered, &ldquo;that I dare not consent to the
      exposure of a public trial, for the sake of persons living and dead. For
      the same reason, I have written the account of the conspiracy with certain
      reserves. I hope I have not thrown any needless difficulties in your way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, sir. But I should wish to ask, what you propose to do, in
      case I discover the people concerned in the conspiracy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius owned, very reluctantly, that he could do nothing with the old
      woman who had been the accomplice. &ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I can induce her
      to assist me in bringing the man to justice for other crimes which I
      believe him to have committed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning the man named Jervy, sir, in this statement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have reason to believe that he has been obliged to leave the
      United States, after committing some serious offence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir. Is it serious enough to
      charge him with, under the treaty between the two countries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it&rsquo;s serious enough. I have telegraphed to the persons who
      formerly employed him, for the particulars. Mind this! I will stick at no
      sacrifice to make that scoundrel suffer for what he has done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In those plain words Amelius revealed, as frankly as usual, the purpose
      that was in him. The terrible remembrances associated with Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s
      last moments had kindled, in his just and generous nature, a burning sense
      of the wrong inflicted on the poor heart-broken creature who had trusted
      and loved him. The unendurable thought that the wretch who had tortured
      her, robbed her, and driven her to her death had escaped with impunity,
      literally haunted him night and day. Eager to provide for Sally&rsquo;s future,
      he had followed Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s instructions, and had seen the lawyer
      privately, during the period that had elapsed between the death and the
      inquest. Hearing that there were formalities to be complied with, which
      would probably cause some delay, he had at once announced his
      determination to employ the interval in attempting the pursuit of Jervy.
      The lawyer&mdash;after vainly pointing out the serious objections to the
      course proposed&mdash;so far yielded to the irresistible earnestness and
      good faith of Amelius as to recommend him to a competent man, who could be
      trusted not to deceive him. The same day the man had received a written
      statement of the case; and he had now arrived to report the result of his
      first proceedings to his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing I want to know, before you tell me anything else,&rdquo; Amelius
      resumed. &ldquo;Is my written description of Jervy plain enough to help you to
      find him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so plain, sir, that some of the older men in our office have
      recognized him by it&mdash;under another name than the name you give him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that add to the difficulty of tracing him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been a long time away from England, sir; and it&rsquo;s by no means easy
      to trace him, on that account. I have been to the young woman, named
      Phoebe in your statement, to find out what she can tell me about him.
      She&rsquo;s ready enough, in the intervals of crying, to help us to lay our
      hands on the man who has deserted her. It&rsquo;s the old story of a fellow
      getting at a girl&rsquo;s secrets and a girl&rsquo;s money, under pretence of marrying
      her. At one time, she&rsquo;s furious with him, and at another she&rsquo;s ready to
      cry her eyes out. I got some information from her; it&rsquo;s not much, but it
      may help us. The name of the old woman, who has been the go-between in the
      business, is Mrs. Sowler&mdash;known to the police as an inveterate
      drunkard, and worse. I don&rsquo;t think there will be much difficulty in
      tracing Mrs. Sowler. As to Jervy, if the young woman is to be believed,
      and I think she is, there&rsquo;s little doubt that he has got the money from
      the lady mentioned in my instructions here, and that he has bolted with
      the sum about him. Wait a bit, sir, I haven&rsquo;t done with my discoveries
      yet. I asked the young woman, of course, if she had his photograph. He&rsquo;s a
      sharp fellow; she had it, but he got it away from her, on pretence of
      giving her a better one, before he took himself off. Having missed this
      chance, I asked next if she knew where he lived last. She directed me to
      the place; and I have had a talk with the landlord. He tells me of a
      squint-eyed man, who was a good deal about the house, doing Jervy&rsquo;s dirty
      work for him. If I am not misled by the description, I think I know the
      man. I have my own notion of what he&rsquo;s capable of doing, if he gets the
      chance&mdash;and I propose to begin by finding our way to him, and using
      him as a means of tracing Jervy. It&rsquo;s only right to tell you that it may
      take some time to do this&mdash;for which reason I have to propose, in the
      mean while, trying a shorter way to the end in view. Do you object, sir,
      to the expense of sending a copy of your description of Jervy to every
      police-station in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I object to nothing which may help to find him. Do you think the police
      have got him anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, sir, that the police have no orders to take him. What I&rsquo;m
      speculating on is the chance that he has got the money about him&mdash;say
      in small banknotes, for convenience of changing them, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, the people he lives among&mdash;the squint-eyed man, for
      instance!&mdash;don&rsquo;t stick at trifles. If any of them have found out that
      Jervy&rsquo;s purse is worth having&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean they would rob him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And murder him too, sir, if he tried to resist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius started to his feet. &ldquo;Send round to the police-stations without
      losing another minute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And let me hear what the answer is, the
      instant you receive it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I get the answer late at night, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care when you get it, night or day. Dead or living, I will
      undertake to identify him. Here&rsquo;s a duplicate key of the garden gate. Come
      this way, and I&rsquo;ll show you where my bedroom is. If we are all in bed, tap
      at the window&mdash;and I will be ready for you at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On that understanding Morcross left the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day when the mortal remains of Mrs. Farnaby were laid at rest was a
      day of heavy rain. Mr. Melton, and two or three other old friends, were
      the attendants at the funeral. When the coffin was borne into the damp and
      reeking burial ground, a young man and a woman were the only persons,
      beside the sexton and his assistants, who stood by the open grave. Mr.
      Melton, recognizing Amelius, was at a loss to understand who his companion
      could be. It was impossible to suppose that he would profane that solemn
      ceremony by bringing to it the lost woman at the cottage. The thick black
      veil of the person with him hid her face from view. No visible expressions
      of grief escaped her. When the last sublime words of the burial service
      had been read, those two mourners were left, after the others had all
      departed, still standing together by the grave. Mr. Melton decided on
      mentioning the circumstance confidentially when he wrote to his friend in
      Paris. Telegrams from Regina, in reply to his telegrams from London, had
      informed him that Mr. Farnaby had felt the benefit of the remedies
      employed, and was slowly on the way to recovery. It seemed likely that he
      would, in no long time, take the right course for the protection of his
      niece. For the enlightenment which might, or might not, come with that
      time, Mr. Melton was resigned to wait, with the disciplined patience to
      which he had been mainly indebted for his success in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always remember your mother tenderly, my child,&rdquo; said Amelius, as they
      left the burial ground. &ldquo;She was sorely tried, poor thing, in her life
      time, and she loved you very dearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything of my father?&rdquo; Sally asked timidly. &ldquo;Is he still
      living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you will never see your father. I must be all that the kindest
      father and mother could have been to you, now. Oh, my poor little girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed his arm to her as she held it. &ldquo;Why should you pity me?&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I got You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed the day together quietly at the cottage. Amelius took down
      some of his books, and pleased Sally by giving her his first lessons. Soon
      after ten o&rsquo;clock she withdrew, at the usual early hour, to her room. In
      her absence, he sent for Toff, intending to warn him not to be alarmed if
      he heard footsteps in the garden, after they had all gone to bed. The old
      servant had barely entered the library, when he was called away by the
      bell at the outer gate. Amelius, looking into the hall, discovered
      Morcross, and signed to him eagerly to come in. The police-officer closed
      the door cautiously behind him. He had arrived with news that Jervy was
      found.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Where has he been found?&rdquo; Amelius asked, snatching up his hat.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hurry, sir,&rdquo; Morcross answered quietly. &ldquo;When I had the honour
      of seeing you yesterday, you said you meant to make Jervy suffer for what
      he had done. Somebody else has saved you the trouble. He was found this
      evening in the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drowned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stabbed in three places, sir; and put out of the way in the river&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the surgeon&rsquo;s report. Robbed of everything he possessed&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
      police report, after searching his pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius was silent. It had not entered into his calculations that crime
      breeds crime, and that the criminal might escape him under that law. For
      the moment, he was conscious of a sense of disappointment, revealing
      plainly that the desire for vengeance had mingled with the higher motives
      which animated him. He felt uneasy and ashamed, and longed as usual to
      take refuge in action from his own unwelcome thoughts. &ldquo;Are you sure it is
      the man?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;My description may have misled the police&mdash;I
      should like to see him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir. While we are about it, if you feel any curiosity to trace
      Jervy&rsquo;s ill-gotten money, there&rsquo;s a chance (from what I have heard) of
      finding the man with the squint. The people at our place think it&rsquo;s likely
      he may have been concerned in the robbery, if he hasn&rsquo;t committed the
      murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an hour after, under the guidance of Morcross, Amelius passed through
      the dreary doors of a deadhouse, situated on the southern bank of the
      Thames, and saw the body of Jervy stretched out on a stone slab. The
      guardian who held the lantern, inured to such horrible sights, declared
      that the corpse could not have been in the water more than two days. To
      any one who had seen the murdered man, the face, undisfigured by injury of
      any kind, was perfectly recognizable. Amelius knew him again, dead, as
      certainly as he had known him again, living, when he was waiting for
      Phoebe in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re satisfied, sir,&rdquo; said Morcross, &ldquo;the inspector at the
      police-station is sending a sergeant to look after &lsquo;Wall-Eyes&rsquo;&mdash;the
      name they give hereabouts to the man suspected of the robbery. We can take
      the sergeant with us in the cab, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still keeping on the southern bank of the river, they drove for a quarter
      of an hour in a westerly direction, and stopped at a public-house. The
      sergeant of police went in by himself to make the first inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are a day too late, sir,&rdquo; he said to Amelius, on returning to the cab.
      &ldquo;Wall-Eyes was here last night, and Mother Sowler with him, judging by the
      description. Both of them drunk&mdash;and the woman the worse of the two.
      The landlord knew nothing more about it; but there&rsquo;s a man at the bar
      tells me he heard of them this morning (still drinking) at the Dairy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Dairy?&rdquo; Amelius repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morcross interposed with the necessary explanation. &ldquo;An old house, sir,
      which once stood by itself in the fields. It was a dairy a hundred years
      ago; and it has kept the name ever since, though it&rsquo;s nothing but a low
      lodging house now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the worst places on this side of the river,&rdquo; the sergeant added,
      &ldquo;The landlord&rsquo;s a returned convict. Sly as he is we shall have him again
      yet, for receiving stolen goods. There&rsquo;s every sort of thief among his
      lodgers, from a pickpocket to a housebreaker. It&rsquo;s my duty to continue the
      inquiry, sir; but a gentleman like you will be better, I should say, out
      of such a place as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still disquieted by the sight that he had seen in the deadhouse, and by
      the associations which that sight had recalled, Amelius was ready for any
      adventure which might relieve his mind. Even the prospect of a visit to a
      thieves&rsquo; lodging house was more welcome to him than the prospect of going
      home alone. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no serious objection to it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I own I
      should like to see the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be safe enough with us,&rdquo; the sergeant replied. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind
      filthy people and bad language&mdash;all right, sir! Cabman, drive to the
      Dairy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their direction was now towards the south, through a perfect labyrinth of
      mean and dirty streets. Twice the driver was obliged to ask his way. On
      the second occasion the sergeant, putting his head out of the window to
      stop the cab, cried, &ldquo;Hullo! there&rsquo;s something up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They got out in front of a long low rambling house, a complete contrast to
      the modern buildings about it. Late as the hour was, a mob had assembled
      in front of the door. The police were on the spot keeping the people in
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morcross and the sergeant pushed their way through the crowd, leading
      Amelius between them. &ldquo;Something wrong, sir, in the back kitchen,&rdquo; said
      one of the policemen answering the sergeant while he opened the street
      door. A few yards down the passage there was a second door, with a man on
      the watch by it. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a nice to-do downstairs,&rdquo; the man announced,
      recognizing the sergeant, and unlocking the door with a key which he took
      from his pocket. &ldquo;The landlord at the Dairy knows his lodgers, sir,&rdquo;
       Morcross whispered to Amelius; &ldquo;the place is kept like a prison.&rdquo; As they
      passed through the second door, a frantic voice startled them, shouting in
      fury from below. An old man came hobbling up the kitchen stairs, his eyes
      wild with fear, his long grey hair all tumbled over his face. &ldquo;Oh, Lord,
      have you got the tools for breaking open the door?&rdquo; he asked, wringing his
      dirty hands in an agony of supplication. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll set the house on fire!
      she&rsquo;ll kill my wife and daughter!&rdquo; The sergeant pushed him contemptuously
      out of the way, and looked round for Amelius. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the landlord,
      sir; keep near Morcross, and follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They descended the kitchen stairs, the frantic cries below growing louder
      and louder at every step they took; and made their way through the thieves
      and vagabonds crowding together in the passage. Passing on their right
      hand a solid old oaken door fast closed, they reached an open wicket-gate
      of iron which led into a stone-paved yard. A heavily barred window was now
      visible in the back wall of the house, raised three or four feet from the
      pavement of the yard. The room within was illuminated by a blaze of
      gaslight. More policemen were here, keeping back more inquisitive lodgers.
      Among the spectators was a man with a hideous outward squint, holding by
      the window-bars in a state of drunken terror. The sergeant looked at him,
      and beckoned to one of the policemen. &ldquo;Take him to the station; I shall
      have something to say to Wall-Eyes when he&rsquo;s sober. Now then! stand back
      all of you, and let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s going on in the kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took Amelius by the arm, and led him to the window. Even the sergeant
      started when the scene inside met his view. &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      Mother Sowler herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It <i>was</i> Mother Sowler. The horrible woman was tramping round and
      round in the middle of the kitchen, like a beast in a cage; raving in the
      dreadful drink-madness called delirium tremens. In the farthest corner of
      the room, barricaded behind the table, the landlord&rsquo;s wife and daughter
      crouched in terror of their lives. The gas, turned full on, blazed high
      enough to blacken the ceiling, and showed the heavy bolts shot at the top
      and bottom of the solid door. Nothing less than a battering-ram could have
      burst that door in from the outer side; an hour&rsquo;s work with the file would
      have failed to break a passage through the bars over the window. &ldquo;How did
      she get there?&rdquo; the sergeant asked. &ldquo;Run downstairs, and bolted herself
      in, while the missus and the young &lsquo;un were cooking&rdquo;&mdash;was the
      answering cry from the people in the yard. As they spoke, another vain
      attempt was made to break in the door from the passage. The noise of the
      heavy blows redoubled the frenzy of the terrible creature in the kitchen,
      still tramping round and round under the blazing gaslight. Suddenly, she
      made a dart at the window, and confronted the men looking in from the
      yard. Her staring eyes were bloodshot; a purple-red flush was over her
      face; her hair waved wildly about her, torn away in places by her own
      hands. &ldquo;Cats!&rdquo; she screamed, glaring out of the window, &ldquo;millions of cats!
      all their months wide open spitting at me! Fire! fire to scare away the
      cats!&rdquo; She searched furiously in her pocket, and tore out a handful of
      loose papers. One of them escaped, and fluttered downward to a wooden
      press under the window. Amelius was nearest, and saw it plainly as it
      fell, &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a bank-note!&rdquo; &ldquo;Wall-Eyes&rsquo; 
      money!&rdquo; shouted the thieves in the yard; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to burn Wall-Eyes&rsquo; 
      money!&rdquo; The madwoman turned back to the middle of the kitchen, leapt up at
      the gas-burner, and set fire to the bank-notes. She scattered them flaming
      all round her on the kitchen floor. &ldquo;Away with you!&rdquo; she shouted, shaking
      her fists at the visionary multitude of cats. &ldquo;Away with you, up the
      chimney! Away with you, out of the window!&rdquo; She sprang back to the window,
      with her crooked fingers twisted in her hair! &ldquo;The snakes!&rdquo; she shrieked;
      &ldquo;the snakes are hissing again in my hair! the beetles are crawling over my
      face!&rdquo; She tore at her hair; she scraped her face with long black nails
      that lacerated the flesh. Amelius turned away, unable to endure the sight
      of her. Morcross took his place, eyed her steadily for a moment, and saw
      the way to end it. &ldquo;A quarter of gin!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Quick! before she
      leaves the window!&rdquo; In a minute he had the pewter measure in his hand, and
      tapped at the window. &ldquo;Gin, Mother Sowler! Break the window, and have a
      drop of gin!&rdquo; For a moment, the drunkard mastered her own dreadful visions
      at the sight of the liquor. She broke a pane of glass with her clenched
      fist. &ldquo;The door!&rdquo; cried Morcross, to the panic-stricken women, barricaded
      behind the table. &ldquo;The door!&rdquo; he reiterated, as he handed the gin in
      through the bars. The elder woman was too terrified to understand him; her
      bolder daughter crawled under the table, rushed across the kitchen, and
      drew the bolts. As the madwoman turned to attack her, the room was filled
      with men, headed by the sergeant. Three of them were barely enough to
      control the frantic wretch, and bind her hand and foot. When Amelius
      entered the kitchen, after she had been conveyed to the hospital, a
      five-pound note on the press (secured by one of the police), and a few
      frail black ashes scattered thinly on the kitchen floor, were the only
      relics left of the ill-gotten money.
    </p>
    <p>
      After-inquiry, patiently pursued in more than one direction, failed to
      throw any light on the mystery of Jervy&rsquo;s death. Morcross&rsquo;s report to
      Amelius, towards the close of the investigation, was little more than
      ingenious guess-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems pretty clear, sir, in the first place, that Mother Sowler must
      have overtaken Wall-Eyes, after he had left the letter at Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s
      lodgings. In the second place, we are justified (as I shall show you
      directly) in assuming that she told him of the money in Jervy&rsquo;s
      possession, and that the two succeeded in discovering Jervy&mdash;no doubt
      through Wall-Eyes&rsquo; superior knowledge of his master&rsquo;s movements. The
      evidence concerning the bank-notes proves this. We know, by the
      examination of the people at the Dairy, that Wall-Eyes took from his
      pocket a handful of notes, when they refused to send for liquor without
      having the money first. We are also informed, that the breaking-out of the
      drink-madness in Mother Sowler showed itself in her snatching the notes
      out of his hand, and trying to strangle him&mdash;before she ran down into
      the kitchen and bolted herself in. Lastly, Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s bankers have
      identified the note saved from the burning, as one of forty five-pound
      notes paid to her cheque. So much for the tracing of the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could give an equally satisfactory account of the tracing of the
      crime. We can make nothing of Wall-Eyes. He declares that he didn&rsquo;t even
      know Jervy was dead, till we told him; and he swears he found the money
      dropped in the street. It is needless to say that this last assertion is a
      lie. Opinions are divided among us as to whether he is answerable for the
      murder as well as the robbery, or whether there was a third person
      concerned in it. My own belief is that Jervy was drugged by the old woman
      (with a young woman very likely used as a decoy), in some house by the
      riverside, and then murdered by Wall-Eyes in cold blood. We have done our
      best to clear the matter up, and we have not succeeded. The doctors give
      us no hope of any assistance from Mother Sowler. If she gets over the
      attack (which is doubtful), they say she will die to a certainty of liver
      disease. In short, my own fear is that this will prove to be one more of
      those murders which are mysteries to the police as well as the public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The report of the case excited some interest, published in the newspapers
      in conspicuous type. Meddlesome readers wrote letters, offering
      complacently stupid suggestions to the police. After a while, another
      crime attracted general attention; and the murder of Jervy disappeared
      from the public memory, among other forgotten murders of modern times.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The last dreary days of November came to their end.
    </h3>
    <p>
      No longer darkened by the shadows of crime and torment and death, the life
      of Amelius glided insensibly into the peaceful byways of seclusion,
      brightened by the companionship of Sally. The winter days followed one
      another in a happy uniformity of occupations and amusements. There were
      lessons to fill up the morning, and walks to occupy the afternoon&mdash;and,
      in the evenings, sometimes reading, sometimes singing, sometimes nothing
      but the lazy luxury of talk. In the vast world of London, with its
      monstrous extremes of wealth and poverty, and its all-permeating malady of
      life at fever-heat, there was one supremely innocent and supremely happy
      creature. Sally had heard of Heaven, attainable on the hard condition of
      first paying the debt of death. &ldquo;I have found a kinder Heaven,&rdquo; she said,
      one day. &ldquo;It is here in the cottage; and Amelius has shown me the way to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their social isolation was at this time complete: they were two friendless
      people, perfectly insensible to all that was perilous and pitiable in
      their own position. They parted with a kiss at night, and they met again
      with a kiss in the morning&mdash;and they were as happily free from all
      mistrust of the future as a pair of birds. No visitors came to the house;
      the few friends and acquaintances of Amelius, forgotten by him, forgot him
      in return. Now and then, Toff&rsquo;s wife came to the cottage, and exhibited
      the &ldquo;cherubim-baby.&rdquo; Now and then, Toff himself (a musician among his
      other accomplishments) brought his fiddle upstairs; and, saying modestly,
      &ldquo;A little music helps to pass the time,&rdquo; played to the young master and
      mistress the cheerful tinkling tunes of the old vaudevilles of France.
      They were pleased with these small interruptions when they came; and they
      were not disappointed when the days passed, and the baby and the
      vaudevilles were hushed in absence and silence. So the happy winter time
      went by; and the howling winds brought no rheumatism with them, and even
      the tax-gatherer himself, looking in at this earthly paradise, departed
      without a curse when he left his little paper behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then, at long intervals, the outer world intruded itself in the
      form of a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina wrote, always with the same placid affection; always entering into
      the same minute narrative of the slow progress of &ldquo;dear uncle&rsquo;s&rdquo; return to
      health. He was forbidden to exert himself in any way. His nerves were in a
      state of lamentable irritability. &ldquo;I dare not even mention your name to
      him, dear Amelius; it seems, I cannot think why, to make him&mdash;oh, so
      unreasonably angry. I can only submit, and pray that he may soon be
      himself again.&rdquo; Amelius wrote back, always in the same considerate and
      gentle tone; always laying the blame of his dull letters on the studious
      uniformity of his life. He preserved, with a perfectly easy conscience,
      the most absolute silence on the subject of Sally. While he was faithful
      to Regina, what reason had he to reproach himself with the protection that
      he offered to a poor motherless girl? When he was married, he might
      mention the circumstances under which he had met with Sally, and leave the
      rest to his wife&rsquo;s sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, the letters with the Paris post-mark were varied by a few
      lines from Rufus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every morning, my bright boy, I get up and say to myself, &lsquo;Well! I reckon
      it&rsquo;s about time to take the route for London;&rsquo; and every morning, if
      you&rsquo;ll believe me, I put it off till next day. Whether it&rsquo;s in the good
      feeding (expensive, I admit; but when your cook helps you to digest
      instead of hindering you, a man of my dyspeptic nation is too grateful to
      complain)&mdash;or whether it&rsquo;s in the air, which reminds me, I do assure
      you, of our native atmosphere at Coolspring, Mass., is more than I can
      tell, with a hard steel pen on a leaf of flimsy paper. You have heard the
      saying, &lsquo;When a good American dies, he goes to Paris&rsquo;. Maybe, sometimes,
      he&rsquo;s smart enough to discount his own death, and rationally enjoy the
      future time in the present. This you see is a poetic light. But, mercy be
      praised, the moral of my residence in Paris is plain:&mdash;If I can&rsquo;t go
      to Amelius, Amelius must come to me. Note the address Grand Hotel; and
      pack up, like a good boy, on receipt of this. Memorandum: The brown Miss
      is here. I saw her taking the air in a carriage, and raised my hat. She
      looked the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;British&mdash;eminently British! But, there, I bear no malice; I am her
      most obedient servant, and yours affectionately, RUFUS.&mdash;Postscript:
      I want you to see some of our girls at this hotel. The genuine American
      material, sir, perfected by Worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another morning brought with it a few sad lines from Phoebe. &ldquo;After what
      had happened, she was quite unable to face her friends; she had no heart
      to seek employment in her own country&mdash;her present life was too
      dreary and too hopeless to be endured. A benevolent lady had made her an
      offer to accompany a party of emigrants to New Zealand; and she had
      accepted the proposal. Perhaps, among the new people, she might recover
      her self-respect and her spirits, and live to be a better woman.
      Meanwhile, she bade Mr. Goldenheart farewell; and asked his pardon for
      taking the liberty of wishing him happy with Miss Regina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius wrote a few kind lines to Phoebe, and a cordial reply to Rufus,
      making the pursuit of his studies his excuse for remaining in London.
      After this, there was no further correspondence. The mornings succeeded
      each other, and the postman brought no more news from the world outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lessons went on; and the teacher and pupil were as inconsiderately
      happy as ever in each other&rsquo;s society. Observing with inexhaustible
      interest the progress of the mental development of Sally, Amelius was slow
      to perceive the physical development which was unobtrusively keeping pace
      with it. He was absolutely ignorant of the part which his own influence
      was taking in the gradual and delicate process of change. Ere long, the
      first forewarnings of the coming disturbance in their harmless relations
      towards each other, began to show themselves. Ere long, there were signs
      of a troubled mind in Sally, which were mysteries to Amelius, and subjects
      of wonderment, sometimes even trials of temper, to the girl herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, she looked in from the door of her room, in her white
      dressing-gown, and asked to be forgiven if she kept the lessons of the
      morning waiting for a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Amelius, &ldquo;and tell me why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t think me lazy, if you see me in my
      dressing-gown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not! Your dressing-gown, my dear, is as good as any other gown.
      A young girl like you looks best in white.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came in with her work-basket, and her indoor dress over her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius laughed. &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you put it on?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down in a corner, and looked at her work-basket, instead of
      looking at Amelius. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t fit me so well as it did,&rdquo; she answered.
      &ldquo;I am obliged to alter it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked at her&mdash;at the charming youthful figure that had
      filled out, at the softly-rounded outline of the face with no angles and
      hollows in it now. &ldquo;Is it the dressmaker&rsquo;s fault?&rdquo; he asked slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were still on the basket. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
      remember what a poor little skinny creature I was, when you first saw me.
      I&mdash;you won&rsquo;t like me the worse for it, will you?&mdash;I am getting
      fat. I don&rsquo;t know why. They say happy people get fat. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why.
      I&rsquo;m never hungry, and never frightened, and never miserable now&mdash;&rdquo;
       She stopped; her dress slipped from her lap to the floor. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at
      me!&rdquo; she said&mdash;and suddenly put her hands over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius saw the tears finding their way through the pretty plump fingers,
      which he remembered so shapeless and so thin. He crossed the room, and
      touched her gently on the shoulder. &ldquo;My dear child! have I said anything
      to distress you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why are you crying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She hesitated; looked at him; and made a desperate effort
      to tell him what was in her mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll get tired of me.
      There&rsquo;s nothing about me to make you pity me now. You seem to be&mdash;not
      quite the same&mdash;no! it isn&rsquo;t that&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s come to
      me&mdash;I&rsquo;m a greater fool than ever. Give me my lesson, Amelius! please
      give me my lesson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius produced the books, in some little surprise at Sally&rsquo;s
      extraordinary anxiety to begin her lessons, while the unaltered dress lay
      neglected on the carpet at her feet. A discreet abstract of the history of
      England, published for the use of young persons, happened to be at the top
      of the books. The system of education under Amelius recognized the laws of
      chance: they began with the history, because it turned up first. Sally
      read aloud; and Sally&rsquo;s master explained obscure passages, and corrected
      occasional errors of pronunciation, as she went on. On that particular
      morning, there was little to explain and nothing to correct. &ldquo;Am I doing
      it well today?&rdquo; Sally inquired, on reaching the end of her task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shut the book, and looked at her teacher. &ldquo;I wonder how it is,&rdquo; she
      resumed, &ldquo;that I get on so much better with my lessons here than I did at
      the Home? And yet it&rsquo;s foolish of me to wonder. I get on better, because
      you are teaching me, of course. But I don&rsquo;t feel satisfied with myself.
      I&rsquo;m the same helpless creature&mdash;I feel your kindness, and can&rsquo;t make
      any return to you&mdash;for all my learning. I should like&mdash;&rdquo; She
      left the thought in her unexpressed, and opened her copy-book. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my
      writing now,&rdquo; she said, in a quiet resigned way. &ldquo;Perhaps I may improve
      enough, some day, to keep your accounts for you.&rdquo; She chose her pen a
      little absently, and began to write. Amelius looked over her shoulder, and
      laughed; she was writing his name. He pointed to the copper-plate copy on
      the top line, presenting an undeniable moral maxim, in characters beyond
      the reach of criticism:&mdash;Change Is A Law Of Nature. &ldquo;There, my dear,
      you are to copy that till you&rsquo;re tired of it,&rdquo; said the easy master; &ldquo;and
      then we&rsquo;ll try overleaf, another copy beginning with letter D.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally laid down her pen. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like &lsquo;Change is a law of Nature&rsquo;,&rdquo; she
      said, knitting her pretty eyebrows into a frown. &ldquo;I looked at those words
      yesterday, and they made me miserable at night. I was foolish enough to
      think that we should always go on together as we go on now, till I saw
      that copy. I hate the copy! It came to my mind when I was awake in the
      dark, and it seemed to tell me that <i>we</i> were going to change some
      day. That&rsquo;s the worst of learning&mdash;one knows too much, and then
      there&rsquo;s an end of one&rsquo;s happiness. Thoughts come to you, when you don&rsquo;t
      want them. I thought of the young lady we saw last week in the park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke gravely and sadly. The bright contentment which had given a new
      charm to her eyes since she had been at the cottage, died out of them as
      Amelius looked at her. What had become of her childish manner and her
      artless smile? He drew his chair nearer to her. &ldquo;What young lady do you
      mean?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally shook her head, and traced lines with her pen on the blotting paper.
      &ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t have forgotten her! A young lady, riding on a grand white
      horse. All the people were admiring her. I wonder you cared to look at me,
      after that beautiful creature had gone by. Ah, she knows all sorts of
      things that I don&rsquo;t&mdash;<i>she</i> doesn&rsquo;t sound a note at a time on the
      piano, and as often as not the wrong one; <i>she</i> can say her
      multiplication table, and knows all the cities in the world. I dare say
      she&rsquo;s almost as learned as you are. If you had her living here with you,
      wouldn&rsquo;t you like it better than only having me!&rdquo; She dropped her arms on
      the table, and laid her head on them wearily. &ldquo;The dreadful streets!&rdquo; she
      murmured, in low tones of despair. &ldquo;Why did I think of the dreadful
      streets, and the night I met with you&mdash;after I had seen the young
      lady? Oh, Amelius, are you tired of me? are you ashamed of me?&rdquo; She lifted
      her head again, before he could answer, and controlled herself by a sudden
      effort of resolution. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter with me this
      morning,&rdquo; she said, looking at him with a pleading fear in her eyes.
      &ldquo;Never mind my nonsense&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do the copy!&rdquo; She began to write the
      unendurable assertion that change is a law of Nature, with trembling
      fingers and fast heaving breath. Amelius took the pen gently out of her
      hand. His voice faltered as he spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will give up the lessons for today, Sally. You have had a bad night&rsquo;s
      rest, my dear, and you are feeling it&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Do you think you
      are well enough to come out with me, and try if the air will revive you a
      little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and took his hand, and kissed it. &ldquo;I believe, if I was dying, I
      should get well enough to go out with you! May I ask one little favour? Do
      you mind if we don&rsquo;t go into the park today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has made you take a dislike to the park, Sally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might meet the beautiful young lady again,&rdquo; she answered, with her
      head down. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go wherever you like, my child. You shall decide&mdash;not I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gathered up her dress from the floor, and hurried away to her room&mdash;without
      looking back at him as usual when she opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left by himself, Amelius sat at the table, mechanically turning over the
      lesson-books. Sally had perplexed and even distressed him. His capacity to
      preserve the harmless relations between them, depended mainly on the mute
      appeal which the girl&rsquo;s ignorant innocence unconsciously addressed to him.
      He felt this vaguely, without absolutely realizing it. By some mysterious
      process of association which he was unable to follow, a saying of the wise
      Elder Brother at Tadmor revived in his memory, while he was trying to see
      his way through the difficulties that beset him. &ldquo;You will meet with many
      temptations, Amelius, when you leave our Community,&rdquo; the old man had said
      at parting; &ldquo;and most of them will come to you through women. Be
      especially on your guard, my son, if you meet with a woman who makes you
      feel truly sorry for her. She is on the high-road to your passions,
      through the open door of your sympathies&mdash;and all the more certainly
      if she is not aware of it herself.&rdquo; Amelius felt the truth expressed in
      those words as he had never felt it yet. There had been signs of a
      changing nature in Sally for some little time past. But they had expressed
      themselves too delicately to attract the attention of a man unprepared to
      be on the watch. Only on that morning, they had been marked enough to
      force themselves on his notice. Only on that morning, she had looked at
      him, and spoken to him, as she had never looked or spoken before. He began
      dimly to see the danger for both of them, to which he had shut his eyes
      thus far. Where was the remedy? what ought he to do? Those questions came
      naturally into his mind&mdash;and yet, his mind shrank from pursuing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up impatiently, and busied himself in putting away the lesson-books&mdash;a
      small duty hitherto always left to Toff.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was useless; his mind dwelt persistently on Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he moved about the room, he still saw the look in her eyes, he still
      heard the tone of her voice, when she spoke of the young lady in the park.
      The words of the good physician whom he had consulted about her recurred
      to his memory now. &ldquo;The natural growth of her senses has been stunted,
      like the natural growth of her body, by starvation, terror, exposure to
      cold, and other influences inherent in the life that she has led.&rdquo; And
      then the doctor had spoken of nourishing food, pure air, and careful
      treatment&mdash;of the life, in short, which she had led at the cottage&mdash;and
      had predicted that she would develop into &ldquo;an intelligent and healthy
      young woman.&rdquo; Again he asked himself, &ldquo;What ought I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned aside to the window, and looked out. An idea occurred to him.
      How would it be, if he summoned courage enough to tell her that he was
      engaged to be married?
    </p>
    <p>
      No! Setting aside his natural dread of the shock that he might inflict on
      the poor grateful girl who had only known happiness under his care, the
      detestable obstacle of Mr. Farnaby stood immovably in his way. Sally would
      be sure to ask questions about his engagement, and would never rest until
      they were answered. It had been necessarily impossible to conceal her
      mother&rsquo;s name from her. The discovery of her father, if she heard of
      Regina and Regina&rsquo;s uncle, would be simply a question of time. What might
      such a man be not capable of doing, what new act of treachery might he not
      commit, if he found himself claimed by the daughter whom he had deserted?
      Even if the expression of Mrs. Farnaby&rsquo;s last wishes had not been sacred
      to Amelius, this consideration alone would have kept him silent, for
      Sally&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now doubted for the first time if he had calculated wisely in planning
      to trust Sally&rsquo;s sad story, after his marriage, to the sympathies of his
      wife. The jealousy that she might naturally feel of a young girl, who was
      an object of interest to her husband, did not present the worst difficulty
      to contend with. She believed in her uncle&rsquo;s integrity as she believed in
      her religion. What would she say, what would she do, if the innocent
      witness to Farnaby&rsquo;s infamy was presented to her; if Amelius asked the
      protection for Sally which her own father had refused to her in her
      infancy; and if he said, as he must say, &ldquo;Your uncle is the man&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, what prospect could he see but the prospect of making the
      disclosure when he looked to his own interests next, and thought of his
      wedding day? Again the sinister figure of Farnaby confronted him. How
      could he receive the wretch whom Regina would innocently welcome to the
      house? There would be no longer a choice left; it would be his duty to
      himself to tell his wife the terrible truth. And what would be the result?
      He recalled the whole course of his courtship, and saw Farnaby always on a
      level with himself in Regina&rsquo;s estimation. In spite of his natural
      cheerfulness, in spite of his inbred courage, his heart failed him, when
      he thought of the time to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned away from the window, Sally&rsquo;s door opened: she joined him,
      ready for the walk. Her spirits had rallied, assisted by the cheering
      influence of dressing to go out. Her charming smile brightened her face.
      In sheer desperation, reckless of what he did or said, Amelius held out
      both hands to welcome her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Sally!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Look pleased
      and pretty, my dear; let&rsquo;s be happy while we can&mdash;and let the future
      take care of itself!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      The capricious influences which combine to make us happy are never so
      certain to be absent influences as when we are foolish enough to talk
      about them. Amelius had talked about them. When he and Sally left the
      cottage, the road which led them away from the park was also the road
      which led them past a church. The influences of happiness left them at the
      church door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rows of carriages were in waiting; hundreds of idle people were assembled
      about the church steps; the thunderous music of the organ rolled out
      through the open doors&mdash;a grand wedding, with choral service, was in
      course of celebration. Sally begged Amelius to take her in to see it. They
      tried the front entrance, and found it impossible to get through the
      crowd. A side entrance, and a fee to a verger, succeeded better. They
      obtained space enough to stand on, with a view of the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride was a tall buxom girl, splendidly dressed: she performed her
      part in the ceremony with the most unruffled composure. The bridegroom
      exhibited an instructive spectacle of aged Nature, sustained by Art. His
      hair, his complexion, his teeth, his breast, his shoulders, and his legs,
      showed what the wig-maker, the valet, the dentist, the tailor, and the
      hosier can do for a rich old man, who wishes to present a juvenile
      appearance while he is buying a young wife. No less than three clergymen
      were present, conducting the sale. The demeanour of the rich congregation
      was worthy of the glorious bygone days of the Golden Calf. So far as could
      be judged by appearances, one old lady, in a pew close to the place at
      which Amelius and Sally were standing, seemed to be the only person
      present who was not favourably impressed by the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it disgraceful,&rdquo; the old lady remarked to a charming young person
      seated next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the charming young person&mdash;being the legitimate product of the
      present time&mdash;had no more sympathy with questions of sentiment than a
      Hottentot. &ldquo;How can you talk so, grandmamma!&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;He has twenty
      thousand a year&mdash;and that lucky girl will be mistress of the most
      splendid house in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; the old lady persisted; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not the less a disgrace to
      everybody concerned in it. There is many a poor friendless creature,
      driven by hunger to the streets, who has a better claim to our sympathy
      than that shameless girl, selling herself in the house of God! I&rsquo;ll wait
      for you in the carriage&mdash;I won&rsquo;t see any more of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally touched Amelius. &ldquo;Take me out!&rdquo; she whispered faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He supposed that the heat in the church had been too much for her. &ldquo;Are
      you better now?&rdquo; he asked, when they got into the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held fast by his arm. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get farther away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That lady
      is coming after us&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want her to see me again. I am one of the
      creatures she talked about. Is the mark of the streets on me, after all
      you have done to rub it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wild misery in her words presented another development in her
      character which was entirely new to Amelius. &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he
      remonstrated, &ldquo;you distress me when you talk in that way. God knows the
      life you are leading now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sally&rsquo;s mind was still full of its own acutely painful sense of what
      the lady had said. &ldquo;I saw her,&rdquo; she burst out&mdash;&ldquo;I saw her look at me
      while she spoke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she thought you better worth looking at than the bride&mdash;and
      quite right, too!&rdquo; Amelius rejoined. &ldquo;Come, come, Sally, be like yourself.
      You don&rsquo;t want to make me unhappy about you, I am sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had taken the right way with her: she felt that simple appeal, and
      asked his pardon with all the old charm in her manner and her voice. For
      the moment, she was &ldquo;Simple Sally&rdquo; again. They walked on in silence. When
      they had lost sight of the church, Amelius felt her hand beginning to
      tremble on his arm. A mingled expression of tenderness and anxiety showed
      itself in her blue eyes as they looked up at him. &ldquo;I am thinking of
      something else now,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I am thinking of You. May I ask you
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius smiled. The smile was not reflected as usual in Sally&rsquo;s face.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing particular,&rdquo; she explained in an odd hurried way; &ldquo;the
      church put it into my head. You&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated, and tried it under
      another form. &ldquo;Will you be married yourself, Amelius, one of these days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did his best to evade the question. &ldquo;I am not rich, Sally, like the old
      gentleman we have just seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes turned away from him; she sighed softly to herself. &ldquo;You will be
      married some day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will you do one kind thing more for me,
      Amelius, when I die? You remember my reading in the newspaper of the new
      invention for burning the dead&mdash;and my asking you about it. You said
      you thought it was better than burying, and you had a good mind to leave
      directions to be burnt instead of buried, when your time came. When <i>my</i>
      time has come, will you leave other directions about yourself, if I ask
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you are talking in a very strange way! If you will have it that
      I am to be married some day, what has that to do with your death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, Amelius. When I have nothing left to live for, I
      suppose it&rsquo;s as likely as not I may die. Will you tell them to bury me in
      some quiet place, away from London, where there are very few graves? And
      when you leave your directions, don&rsquo;t say you are to be burnt. Say&mdash;when
      you have lived a long, long life, and enjoyed all the happiness you have
      deserved so well&mdash;say you are to be buried, and your grave is to be
      near mine. I should like to think of the same trees shading us, and the
      same flowers growing over us. No! don&rsquo;t tell me I&rsquo;m talking strangely
      again&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear it; I want you to humour me and be kind to me
      about this. Do you mind going home? I&rsquo;m feeling a little tired&mdash;and I
      know I&rsquo;m poor company for you today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The talk flagged at dinner-time, though Toff did his best to keep it
      going.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, the excellent Frenchman made an effort to cheer the two
      dull young people. He came in confidentially with his fiddle, and said he
      had a favour to ask. &ldquo;I possess some knowledge, sir, of the delightful art
      of dancing. Might I teach young Miss to dance? You see, if I may venture
      to say so, the other lessons&mdash;oh, most useful, most important, the
      other lessons! but they are just a little serious. Something to relieve
      her mind, sir&mdash;if you will forgive me for mentioning it. I plead for
      innocent gaiety&mdash;let us dance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He played a few notes on the fiddle, and placed his right foot in
      position, and waited amiably to begin. Sally thanked him, and made the
      excuse that she was tired. She wished Amelius good night, without waiting
      until they were alone together&mdash;and, for the first time, without
      giving him the customary kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toff waited until she had gone, and approached his master on tiptoe, with
      a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I take the liberty of expressing an opinion, sir. A young girl who
      rejects the remedy of the fiddle presents a case of extreme gravity. Don&rsquo;t
      despair, sir! It is my pride and pleasure to be never at a loss, where
      your interests are concerned. This is, I think, a matter for the
      ministrations of a woman. If you have confidence in my wife, I venture to
      suggest a visit from Madame Toff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He discreetly retired, and left his master to think about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time passed&mdash;and Amelius was still thinking, and still as far as
      ever from arriving at a conclusion, when he heard a door opened behind
      him. Sally crossed the room before he could rise from his chair: her
      cheeks were flushed, her eyes were bright, her hair fell loose over her
      shoulders&mdash;she dropped at his feet, and hid her face on his knees.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an ungrateful wretch!&rdquo; she burst out; &ldquo;I never kissed you when I said
      good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the best intentions, Amelius took the worst possible way of composing
      her&mdash;he treated her trouble lightly. &ldquo;Perhaps you forgot it?&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her head, and looked at him, with the tears in her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      bad enough,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but not so bad as that. Oh, don&rsquo;t laugh!
      there&rsquo;s nothing to laugh at. Have you done with liking me? Are you angry
      with me for behaving so badly all day, and bidding you good night as if
      you were Toff? You shan&rsquo;t be angry with me!&rdquo; She jumped up, and sat on his
      knee, and put her arms round his neck. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been to bed,&rdquo; she
      whispered; &ldquo;I was too miserable to go to sleep. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s been
      the matter with me today. I seem to be losing the little sense I ever had.
      Oh, if I could only make you understand how fond I am of you! And yet I&rsquo;ve
      had bitter thoughts, as if I was a burden to you, and I had done a wrong
      thing in coming here&mdash;and you would have told me so, only you pitied
      the poor wretch who had nowhere else to go.&rdquo; She tightened her hold round
      his neck, and laid her burning cheek against his face. &ldquo;Oh, Amelius, my
      heart is sore! Kiss me, and say, &lsquo;Good night, Sally!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was young&mdash;he was a man&mdash;for a moment he lost his self
      control; he kissed her as he had never kissed her yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, he remembered; he recovered himself; he put her gently away from
      him, and led her to the door of her room, and closed it on her in silence.
      For a little while, he waited alone. The interval over, he rang for Toff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think your wife would take Miss Sally as an apprentice?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toff looked astonished. &ldquo;Whatever you wish, sir, my wife will do. Her
      knowledge of the art of dressmaking is&mdash;&rdquo; Words failed him to express
      his wife&rsquo;s immense capacity as a dressmaker. He kissed his hand in mute
      enthusiasm, and blew the kiss in the direction of Madame Toff&rsquo;s
      establishment. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;I ought to tell you one thing,
      sir; the business is small, small, very small. But we are all in the hands
      of Providence&mdash;the business will improve, one day.&rdquo; He lifted his
      shoulders and lifted his eyebrows, and looked perfectly satisfied with his
      wife&rsquo;s prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and speak to Madame Toff myself, tomorrow morning,&rdquo; Amelius
      resumed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite possible that I may be obliged to leave London for a
      little while&mdash;and I must provide in some way for Miss Sally. Don&rsquo;t
      say a word about it to her yet, Toff, and don&rsquo;t look miserable. If I go
      away, I shall take you with me. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff, with his handkerchief halfway to his eyes, recovered his native
      cheerfulness. &ldquo;I am invariably sick at sea, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but, no
      matter, I will attend you to the uttermost ends of the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So honest Amelius planned his way of escape from the critical position in
      which he found himself. He went to his bed, troubled by anxieties which
      kept him waking for many weary hours. Where was he to go to, when he left
      Sally? If he could have known what had happened, on that very day, on the
      other side of the Channel, he might have decided (in spite of the obstacle
      of Mr. Farnaby) on surprising Regina by a visit to Paris.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 7
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the morning when Amelius and Sally (in London) entered the church to
      look at the wedding. Rufus (in Paris) went to the Champs Elysees to take a
      walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had advanced half-way up the magnificent avenue, when he saw Regina for
      the second time, taking her daily drive, with an elderly woman in
      attendance on her. Rufus took off his hat again, perfectly impenetrable to
      the cold reception which he had already experienced. Greatly to his
      surprise, Regina not only returned his salute, but stopped the carriage
      and beckoned to him to speak to her. Looking at her more closely, he
      perceived signs of suffering in her face which completely altered her
      expression as he remembered it. Her magnificent eyes were dim and red; she
      had lost her rich colour; her voice trembled as she spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a few minutes to spare?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole day, if you like, Miss,&rdquo; Rufus answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the woman who accompanied her. &ldquo;Wait here for me, Elizabeth;
      I have something to say to this gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With those words, she got out of the carriage. Rufus offered her his arm.
      She put her hand in it as readily as if they had been old friends. &ldquo;Let us
      take one of the side paths,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;they are almost deserted at this
      time of day. I am afraid I surprise you very much. I can only trust to
      your kindness to forgive me for passing you without notice the last time
      we met. Perhaps it may be some excuse for me that I am in great trouble.
      It is just possible you may be able to relieve my mind. I believe you know
      I am engaged to be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus looked at her with a sudden expression of interest. &ldquo;Is this about
      Amelius?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered him almost inaudibly&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus still kept his eyes fixed on her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to say anything,
      Miss,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;but, if you have any complaint to make of Amelius, I
      should take it as a favour if you would look me straight in the face, and
      mention it plainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the embarrassment which troubled Regina at that moment, he had
      preferred the two requests of all others with which it was most impossible
      for her to comply. She still looked obstinately on the ground; and,
      instead of speaking of Amelius, she diverged to the subject of Mr.
      Farnaby&rsquo;s illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am staying in Paris with my uncle,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He has had a long
      illness; but he is strong enough now to speak to me of things that have
      been on his mind for some time past. He has so surprised me; he has made
      me so miserable about Amelius&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, and put her handkerchief
      to her eyes. Rufus said nothing to console her&mdash;he waited doggedly
      until she was ready to go on. &ldquo;You know Amelius well,&rdquo; she resumed; &ldquo;you
      are fond of him; you believe in him, don&rsquo;t you? Do you think he is capable
      of behaving basely to any person who trusts him? Is it likely, is it
      possible, he could be false and cruel to Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mere question roused the indignation of Rufus. &ldquo;Whoever said that of
      him, Miss, told you a lie! I answer for my boy as I answer for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him at last, with a sudden expression of relief. &ldquo;I said so
      too,&rdquo; she rejoined; &ldquo;I said some enemy had slandered him. My uncle won&rsquo;t
      tell me who it is. He positively forbids me to write to Amelius; he tells
      me I must never see Amelius again&mdash;he is going to write and break off
      the engagement. Oh, it&rsquo;s too cruel! too cruel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus far they had been walking on slowly. But now Rufus stopped,
      determined to make her speak plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a word of advice from me, Miss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Never trust anybody by
      halves. There&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m not ready to do, to set this matter right; but
      I must know what I&rsquo;m about first. What&rsquo;s said against Amelius? Out with
      it, no matter what &lsquo;tis! I&rsquo;m old enough to be your father; and I feel for
      you accordingly&mdash;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thorough sincerity of tone and manner which accompanied those words
      had its effect. Regina blushed and trembled&mdash;but she spoke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle says Amelius has disgraced himself, and insulted me; my uncle
      says there is a person&mdash;a girl living with him&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped,
      with a faint cry of alarm. Her hand, still testing on the arm of Rufus,
      felt him start as the allusion to the girl passed her lips. &ldquo;You have
      heard of it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, God help me, it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True?&rdquo; Rufus repeated, with stern contempt. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s come to you? Haven&rsquo;t
      I told you already, it&rsquo;s a lie? I&rsquo;ll answer to it, Amelius is true to you.
      Will that do? No? You&rsquo;re an obstinate one, Miss&mdash;that you are. Well!
      it&rsquo;s due to the boy that I should set him right with you, if words will do
      it. You know how he&rsquo;s been brought up at Tadmor? Bear that in mind&mdash;and
      now you shall have the truth of it, on the word of an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further preface, he told her how Amelius had met with Sally,
      insisting strongly on the motives of pure humanity by which his friend had
      been actuated. Regina listened with an obstinate expression of distrust
      which would have discouraged most men. Rufus persisted, nevertheless; and,
      to some extent at least, succeeded in producing the right impression. When
      he reached the close of the narrative&mdash;when he asserted that he had
      himself seen Amelius confide the girl unreservedly to the care of a lady
      who was a dear and valued friend of his own; and when he declared that
      there had been no after-meeting between them and no written correspondence&mdash;then,
      at last, Regina owned that he had not encouraged her to trust in the
      honour of Amelius, without reason to justify him. But, even under these
      circumstances, there was a residue of suspicion still left in her mind.
      She asked for the name of the lady to whose benevolent assistance Amelius
      had been indebted. Rufus took out one of his cards, and wrote Mrs.
      Payson&rsquo;s name and address on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your nature, my dear, is not quite so confiding as I could have wished to
      see it,&rdquo; he said, quietly handing her the card. &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t change our
      natures&mdash;can we? And you&rsquo;re not bound to believe a man like me,
      without witnesses to back him. Write to Mrs. Payson, and make your mind
      easy. And, while we are about it, tell me where I can telegraph to you
      tomorrow&mdash;I&rsquo;m off to London by the night mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, you are going to see Amelius?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so. I&rsquo;m too fond of Amelius to let this trouble rest where &lsquo;tis
      now. I&rsquo;ve been away from him, here in Paris, for some little time&mdash;and
      you may tell me (and quite right, too) I can&rsquo;t answer for what may have
      been going on in my absence. No! now we are about it, we&rsquo;ll have it out. I
      mean to see Amelius and see Mrs. Payson, tomorrow morning. Just tell your
      uncle to hold his hand, before he breaks off your marriage, and wait for a
      telegram from me. Well? and this is your address, is it? I know the hotel.
      A nice look-out on the Twillery Gardens&mdash;but a bad cellar of wine, as
      I hear. I&rsquo;m at the Grand Hotel myself, if there&rsquo;s anything else that
      troubles you before evening. Now I look at you again, I reckon there&rsquo;s
      something more to be said, if you&rsquo;ll only let it find its way to your
      tongue. No; it ain&rsquo;t thanks. We&rsquo;ll take the gratitude for granted, and get
      to what&rsquo;s behind it. There&rsquo;s your carriage&mdash;and the good lady looks
      tired of waiting. Well, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only one thing,&rdquo; Regina acknowledged, with her eyes on the ground
      again. &ldquo;Perhaps, when you go to London, you may see the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not likely. Say I do see her&mdash;what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regina&rsquo;s colour began to show itself again. &ldquo;If you do see her,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;I beg and entreat you won&rsquo;t speak of <i>me</i> in her hearing. I should
      die of the shame of it, if she thought herself asked to give him up out of
      pity for me. Promise I am not to be brought forward; promise you won&rsquo;t
      even mention my having spoken to you about it. On your word of honour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus gave her his promise, without showing any hesitation, or making any
      remark. But when she shook hands with him, on returning to the carriage,
      he held her hand for a moment. &ldquo;Please to excuse me, Miss, if I ask one
      question,&rdquo; he said, in tones too low to be heard by any other person. &ldquo;Are
      you really fond of Amelius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised you should doubt it,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I am more&mdash;much
      more than fond of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus handed her silently into the carriage, &ldquo;Fond of him, are you?&rdquo; he
      thought, as he walked away by himself. &ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s a sort of fondness
      that don&rsquo;t wear well, and won&rsquo;t stand washing.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 8
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Early the next morning, Rufus rang at the cottage gate.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Frenchman, and how do <i>you</i> git along? And how&rsquo;s Amelius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff, standing before the gate, answered with the utmost respect, but
      showed no inclination to let the visitor in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amelius has his intervals of laziness,&rdquo; Rufus proceeded; &ldquo;I bet he&rsquo;s in
      bed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young master was up and dressed an hour ago, sir&mdash;he has just
      gone out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so, is it? Well, I&rsquo;ll wait till he comes back.&rdquo; He pushed by
      Toff, and walked into the cottage. &ldquo;Your foreign ceremonies are clean
      thrown away on me,&rdquo; he said, as Toff tried to stop him in the hall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      the American savage; and I&rsquo;m used up with travelling all night. Here&rsquo;s a
      little order for you: whisky, bitters, lemon, and ice&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take a
      cocktail in the library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff made a last desperate effort to get between the visitor and the door.
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, a thousand times; I must most respectfully
      entreat you to wait&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he could explain himself, Rufus, with the most perfect good humour,
      pulled the old man out of his way. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s troubling this venerable
      creature&rsquo;s mind&mdash;&rdquo; he inquired of himself, &ldquo;does he think I don&rsquo;t
      know my way in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the library door&mdash;and found himself face to face with
      Sally. She had risen from her chair, hearing voices outside, and
      hesitating whether to leave the room or not. They confronted each other,
      on either side of the table, in silent dismay. For once Rufus was so
      completely bewildered, that he took refuge in his customary form of
      greeting before he was aware of it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you find yourself, Miss? I take pleasure in renewing our
      acquaintance,&mdash;Thunder! that&rsquo;s not it; I reckon I&rsquo;m off my head. Do
      me the favour, young woman, to forget every word I&rsquo;ve said to you. If any
      mortal creature had told me I should find you here, I should have said
      &lsquo;twas a lie&mdash;and I should have been the liar. That makes a man feel
      bad, I can tell you. No! don&rsquo;t slide off, if you please, into the next
      room&mdash;<i>that</i> won&rsquo;t set things right, nohow. Sit you down again.
      Now I&rsquo;m here, I have something to say. I&rsquo;ll speak first to Mr. Frenchman.
      Listen to this, old sir. If I happen to want a witness standing in the
      doorway, I&rsquo;ll ring the bell; for the present I can do without you. Bong
      Shewer, as we say in your country.&rdquo; He proceeded to shut the door on Toff
      and his remonstrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest, sir, against acts of violence, unworthy of a gentleman!&rdquo; cried
      Toff, struggling to get back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be as angry as you please in the kitchen,&rdquo; Rufus answered, persisting in
      closing the door; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have a noise up here. If you know where your
      master is, go and fetch him&mdash;and the sooner the better.&rdquo; He turned
      back to Sally, and surveyed her for a while in terrible silence. She was
      afraid to look at him; her eyes were on the book which she had been
      reading when he came in. &ldquo;You look to me,&rdquo; Rufus remarked, &ldquo;as if you had
      been settled here for a time. Never mind your book now; you can go back to
      your reading after we&rsquo;ve had a word or two together first.&rdquo; He reached out
      his long arm, and pulled the book to his own side of the table. Sally
      innocently silenced him for the second time. He opened the book, and
      discovered&mdash;the New Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my lesson, if you please, sir. I&rsquo;m to learn it where the pencil mark
      is, before Amelius comes back.&rdquo; She offered her poor little explanation,
      trembling with terror. In spite of himself, Rufus began to look at her
      less sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you call him &lsquo;Amelius&rsquo;, do you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I note that, Miss, as an
      unfavourable sign to begin with. How long, if you please, has Amelius
      turned schoolmarm, for your young ladyship&rsquo;s benefit? Don&rsquo;t you
      understand? Well, you&rsquo;re not the only inhabitant of Great Britain who
      don&rsquo;t understand the English language. I&rsquo;ll put it plainer. When I last
      saw Amelius, you were learning your lessons at the Home. What ill wind,
      Miss, blew you in here? Did Amelius fetch you, or did you come of your own
      accord, without waiting to be whistled for?&rdquo; He spoke coarsely but not
      ill-humouredly. Sally&rsquo;s pretty downcast face was pleading with him for
      mercy, and (as he felt, with supreme contempt for himself) was not
      altogether pleading in vain. &ldquo;If I guessed that you ran away from the
      home,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;should I guess right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered with a sudden accession of confidence. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame Amelius,&rdquo;
       she said; &ldquo;I did run away. I couldn&rsquo;t live without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how you can live, young one, till you&rsquo;ve tried the
      experiment. Well, and what did they do at the Home? Did they send after
      you, to fetch you back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t take me back&mdash;they sent my clothes here after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, those were the rules, I reckon. I begin to see my way to the end of
      it now. Amelius gave you house-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him proudly. &ldquo;He gave me a room of my own,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His next question was the exact repetition of the question which he had
      put to Regina in Paris. The only variety was in the answer that he
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you fond of Amelius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would die for him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus had hitherto spoken, standing. He now took a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Amelius had not been brought up at Tadmor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should take my
      hat, and wish you good morning. As things are, a word more may be a word
      in season. Your lessons here seem to have agreed with you, Miss. You&rsquo;re a
      different sort of girl to what you were when I last saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She surprised him by receiving that remark in silence. The colour left her
      face. She sighed bitterly. The sigh puzzled Rufus: he held his opinion of
      her in suspense, until he had heard more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said just now you would die for Amelius,&rdquo; he went on, eyeing her
      attentively. &ldquo;I take that to be a woman&rsquo;s hysterical way of mentioning
      that she feels interest in Amelius. Are you fond enough of him to leave
      him, if you could only be persuaded that leaving him was for his good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She abruptly left the table, and went to the window. When her back was
      turned to Rufus, she spoke. &ldquo;Am I a disgrace to him?&rdquo; she asked, in tones
      so faint that he could barely hear them. &ldquo;I have had my fears of it,
      before now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If he had been less fond of Amelius, his natural kindness of heart might
      have kept him silent. Even as it was, he made no direct reply. &ldquo;You
      remember how you were living when Amelius first met with you?&rdquo; was all he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sad blue eyes looked at him in patient sorrow; the low sweet voice
      answered&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Only a look and a word&mdash;only the influence of
      an instant&mdash;and, in that instant, Rufus&rsquo;s last doubts of her
      vanished!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I say it reproachfully, my child! I know it was not your
      fault; I know you are to be pitied, and not blamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face towards him&mdash;pale, quiet, and resigned. &ldquo;Pitied,
      and not blamed,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Am I to be forgiven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrank from answering her. There was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said just now,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that I looked like a different girl,
      since you last saw me. I <i>am</i> a different girl. I think of things
      that I never thought of before&mdash;some change, I don&rsquo;t know what, has
      come over me. Oh, my heart does hunger so to be good! I do so long to
      deserve what Amelius has done for me! You have got my book there&mdash;Amelius
      gave it to me; we read in it every day. If Christ had been on earth now,
      is it wrong to think that Christ would have forgiven me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear; it&rsquo;s right to think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, while I live, if I do my best to lead a good life, and if my last
      prayer to God is to take me to heaven, shall I be heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be heard, my child, I don&rsquo;t doubt it. But, you see, you have got
      the world about you to reckon with&mdash;and the world has invented a
      religion of its own. There&rsquo;s no use looking for it in this book of yours.
      It&rsquo;s a religion with the pride of property at the bottom of it, and a
      veneer of benevolent sentiment at the top. It will be very sorry for you,
      and very charitable towards you: in short, it will do everything for you
      except taking you back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had her answer to that. &ldquo;Amelius has taken me back again,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amelius has taken you back again,&rdquo; Rufus agreed. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing
      he&rsquo;s forgotten to do; he has forgotten to count the cost. It seems to be
      left to me to do that. Look here, my girl! I own I doubted you when I
      first came into this room; and I&rsquo;m sorry for it, and I beg your pardon. I
      do believe you&rsquo;re a good girl&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t say why if I was asked, but
      I do believe it for all that. I wish there was no more to be said&mdash;but
      there is more; and neither you nor I must shirk it. Public opinion won&rsquo;t
      deal as tenderly with you as I do; public opinion will make the worst of
      you, and the worst of Amelius. While you&rsquo;re living here with him&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      no disguising it&mdash;you&rsquo;re innocently in the way of the boy&rsquo;s prospects
      in life. I don&rsquo;t know whether you understand me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had turned away from him; she was looking out of the window once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;On the night when Amelius met with me,
      he did wrong to take me away with him. He ought to have left me where I
      was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit! that&rsquo;s as far from my meaning as far can be. There&rsquo;s a
      look-out for everybody; and, if you&rsquo;ll trust me, I&rsquo;ll find a look-out for
      <i>you.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      She paid no heed to what he said: her next words showed that she was
      pursuing her own train of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in the way of his prospects in life,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;You mean that he
      might be married some day, but for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus admitted it cautiously. &ldquo;The thing might happen,&rdquo; was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his friends might come and see him,&rdquo; she went on; her face still
      turned away, and her voice sinking into dull subdued tones. &ldquo;Nobody comes
      here now. You see I understand you. When shall I go away? I had better not
      say good-bye, I suppose?&mdash;it would only distress him. I could slip
      out of the house, couldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus began to feel uneasy. He was prepared for tears&mdash;but not for
      such resignation as this. After a little hesitation, he joined her at the
      window. She never turned towards him; she still looked out straight before
      her; her bright young face had turned pitiably rigid and pale. He spoke to
      her very gently; advising her to think of what he had said, and to do
      nothing in a hurry. She knew the hotel at which he stayed when he was in
      London; and she could write to him there. If she decided to begin a new
      life in another country, he was wholly and truly at her service. He would
      provide a passage for her in the same ship that took him back to America.
      At his age, and known as he was in his own neighbourhood, there would be
      no scandal to fear. He could get her reputably and profitably employed, in
      work which a young girl might undertake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as good as a father to
      you, my poor child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to be friendless,
      if you leave Amelius. I&rsquo;ll see to that! You shall have honest people about
      you&mdash;and innocent pleasure in your new life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him, still with the same dull tearless resignation. &ldquo;What will
      the honest people say,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;when they know who I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have no business to know who you are&mdash;and they shan&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it comes back to the same thing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must deceive the
      honest people, or you can do nothing for me. Amelius had better have left
      me where I was! I disgraced nobody, I was a burden to nobody, <i>there.</i>
      Cold and hunger and ill-treatment can sometimes be merciful friends, in
      their way. If I had been left to them, they would have laid me at rest by
      this time.&rdquo; She turned to Rufus, before he could speak to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
      ungrateful, sir; I&rsquo;ll think of it, as you say; and I&rsquo;ll do all that a poor
      foolish creature can do, to be worthy of the interest you take in me.&rdquo; She
      lifted her hand to her head, with a momentary expression of pain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      got a dull kind of aching here,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it reminds me of my old life,
      when I was sometimes beaten on the head. May I go and lie down a little,
      by myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus took her hand, and pressed it in silence. She looked back at him as
      she opened the door of her room. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t distress Amelius,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I
      can bear anything but that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left alone in the library, Rufus walked restlessly to and fro, driven by a
      troubled mind. &ldquo;I was bound to do it,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;and I ought to be
      satisfied with myself. I&rsquo;m not satisfied. The world is hard on women&mdash;and
      the rights of property is a darned bad reason for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door from the hall was suddenly thrown open. Amelius entered the room.
      He looked flushed and angry&mdash;he refused to take the hand that Rufus
      offered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I hear from Toff? It seems that you forced your way in when
      Sally was here. There are limits to the liberties that a man may take in
      his friend&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Rufus quietly. &ldquo;But when a man hasn&rsquo;t taken liberties,
      there don&rsquo;t seem much to be said. Sally was at the Home, when I last saw
      you&mdash;and nobody told me I should find her in this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have left the room, when you found her here. You have been
      talking to her. If you have said anything about Regina&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said nothing about Miss Regina. You have a hot temper of your own,
      Amelius. Wait a bit, and let it cool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind my temper. I want to know what you have been saying to Sally.
      Stop! I&rsquo;ll ask Sally herself.&rdquo; He crossed the room to the inner door, and
      knocked. &ldquo;Come in here, my dear; I want to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer reached him faintly through the door. &ldquo;I have got a bad
      headache, Amelius. Please let me rest a little.&rdquo; He turned back to Rufus,
      and lowered his voice. But his eyes flashed; he was more angry than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can guess how you have been talking to
      her&mdash;I know what her headache means. Any man who distresses that dear
      little affectionate creature is a man whom I hold as my enemy. I spit upon
      all the worldly considerations which pass muster with people like you! No
      sweeter girl than poor Sally ever breathed the breath of life. Her
      happiness is more precious to me than words can say. She is sacred to me!
      And I have just proved it&mdash;I have just come from a good woman, who
      will teach her an honest way of earning her bread. Not a breath of scandal
      shall blow on her. If you, or any people like you, think I will consent to
      cast her adrift on the world, or consign her to a prison under the name of
      a Home, you little know my nature and my principles. Here&rdquo;&mdash;he
      snatched up the New Testament from the table, and shook it at Rufus&mdash;&ldquo;here
      are my principles, and I&rsquo;m not ashamed of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus took up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing you&rsquo;ll be ashamed of, my son, when you&rsquo;re cool enough
      to think about it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be ashamed of the words you have
      spoken to a friend who loves you. I&rsquo;m not a bit angry myself. You remind
      me of that time on board the steamer, when the quarter-master was going to
      shoot the bird. You made it up with him&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll come to my hotel
      and make it up with me. And then we&rsquo;ll shake hands, and talk about Sally.
      If it&rsquo;s not taking another liberty, I&rsquo;ll trouble you for a light.&rdquo; He
      helped himself to a match from the box on the chimney-piece, lit his
      cigar, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been gone half an hour, before the better nature of Amelius
      urged him to follow Rufus and make his apologies. But he was too anxious
      about Sally to leave the cottage, until he had seen her first. The tone in
      which she had answered him, when he knocked at her door, suggested, to his
      sensitive apprehension, that there was something more serious the matter
      with her than a mere headache. For another hour, he waited patiently, on
      the chance that he might hear her moving in her room. Nothing happened. No
      sound reached his ears, except the occasional rolling of carriage-wheels
      on the road outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      His patience began to fail him, as the second hour moved on. He went to
      the door, and listened, and still heard nothing. A sudden dread struck him
      that she might have fainted. He opened the door a few inches, and spoke to
      her. There was no answer. He looked in. The room was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran into the hall, and called to Toff. Was she, by any chance,
      downstairs? No. Or out in the garden? No. Master and man looked at each
      other in silence. Sally was gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 9
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Toff was the first who recovered himself.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, sir!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With a little thinking, we shall see the way to
      find her. That rude American man, who talked with her this morning, may be
      the person who has brought this misfortune on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius waited to hear no more. There was the chance, at least, that
      something might have been said which had induced her to take refuge with
      Rufus. He ran back to the library to get his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toff followed his master, with another suggestion. &ldquo;One word more, sir,
      before you go. If the American man cannot help us, we must be ready to try
      another way. Permit me to accompany you as far as my wife&rsquo;s shop. I
      propose that she shall come back here with me, and examine poor little
      Miss&rsquo;s bedroom. We will wait, of course, for your return, before anything
      is done. In the mean time, I entreat you not to despair. It is at least
      possible that the means of discovery may be found in the bedroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went out together, taking the first cab that passed them. Amelius
      proceeded alone to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus was in his room. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s gone wrong?&rdquo; he asked, the moment Amelius
      opened the door. &ldquo;Shake hands, my son, and smother up that little trouble
      between us in silence. Your face alarms me&mdash;it does! What of Sally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius started at the question. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus drew back. The mere action said, No, before he answered in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen nothing of her? heard nothing of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Steady, now! Meet it like a man; and tell me what has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius told him in two words. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;m going to break out again
      as I did this morning,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too wretched and too anxious to
      be angry. Only tell me, Rufus, have you said anything to her&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus held up his hand. &ldquo;I see what you&rsquo;re driving at. It will be more to
      the purpose to tell you what she said to me. From first to last, Amelius,
      I spoke kindly to her, and I did her justice. Give me a minute to rummage
      my memory.&rdquo; After brief consideration, he carefully repeated the substance
      of what had passed between Sally and himself, during the latter part of
      the interview between them. &ldquo;Have you looked about in her room?&rdquo; he
      inquired, when he had done. &ldquo;There might be a trifling something to help
      you, left behind her there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius told him of Toff&rsquo;s suggestion. They returned together at once to
      the cottage. Madame Toff was waiting to begin the search.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first discovery was easily made. Sally had taken off one or two little
      trinkets&mdash;presents from Amelius, which she was in the habit of
      wearing&mdash;and had left them, wrapped up in paper, on the
      dressing-table. No such thing as a farewell letter was found near them.
      The examination of the wardrobe came next&mdash;and here a startling
      circumstance revealed itself. Every one of the dresses which Amelius had
      presented to her was hanging in its place. They were not many; and they
      had all, on previous occasions, been passed in review by Toff&rsquo;s wife. She
      was absolutely certain that the complete number of the dresses was there
      in the bedroom. Sally must have worn something, in place of her new
      clothes. What had she put on?
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking round the room, Amelius noticed in a corner the box in which he
      had placed the first new dress that he had purchased for Sally, on the
      morning after they had met. He tried to open the box: it was locked&mdash;and
      the key was not to be found. The ever-ready Toff fetched a skewer from the
      kitchen, and picked the lock in two minutes. On lifting the cover, the box
      proved to be empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one person present who understood what this meant was Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that Sally had taken her old threadbare clothes away with
      her in the box, when the angry landlady had insisted on his leaving the
      house. &ldquo;I want to look at them sometimes,&rdquo; the poor girl had said, &ldquo;and
      think how much better off I am now.&rdquo; In those miserable rags she had fled
      from the cottage, after hearing the cruel truth. &ldquo;He had better have left
      me where I was,&rdquo; she had said. &ldquo;Cold and hunger and ill-treatment would
      have laid me at rest by this time.&rdquo; Amelius fell on his knees before the
      empty box, in helpless despair. The conclusion that now forced itself on
      his mind completely unmanned him. She had gone back, in the old dress, to
      die under the cold, the hunger, and the horror of the old life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus took his hand, and spoke to him kindly. He rallied, and dashed the
      tears from his eyes, and rose to his feet. &ldquo;I know where to look for her,&rdquo;
       was all he said; &ldquo;and I must do it alone.&rdquo; He refused to enter into any
      explanation, or to be assisted by any companion. &ldquo;This is my secret and
      hers,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;Go back to your hotel, Rufus&mdash;and pray that I
      may not bring news which will make a wretched man of you for the rest of
      your life.&rdquo; With that he left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another hour he stood once more on the spot at which he and Sally had
      met.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild bustle and uproar of the costermongers&rsquo; night market no longer
      rioted round him: the street by daylight was in a state of dreary repose.
      Slowly pacing up and down, from one end to another, he waited with but one
      hope to sustain him&mdash;the hope that she might have taken refuge with
      the two women who had been her only friends in the dark days of her life.
      Ignorant of the place in which they lived, he had no choice but to wait
      for the appearance of one or other of them in the street. He was quiet and
      resolved. For the rest of the day, and for the whole of the night if need
      be, his mind was made up to keep steadfastly on the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he could walk no longer, he obtained rest and refreshment in the
      cookshop which he remembered so well; sitting on a stool near the window,
      from which he could still command a view of the street. The gas-lamps were
      alight, and the long winter&rsquo;s night was beginning to set in, when he
      resumed his weary march from end to end of the pavement. As the darkness
      became complete, his patience was rewarded at last. Passing the door of a
      pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop, he met one of the women face to face, walking rapidly,
      with a little parcel under her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recognized him with a cry of joyful surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, how glad I am to see you, to be sure! You&rsquo;ve come to look after
      Sally, haven&rsquo;t you? Yes, yes; she&rsquo;s safe in our poor place&mdash;but in
      such a dreadful state. Off her head! clean off her head! Talks of nothing
      but you. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in the way of his prospects in life.&rsquo; Over and over and over
      again, she keeps on saying that. Don&rsquo;t be afraid; Jenny&rsquo;s at home, taking
      care of her. She wants to go out. Hot and wild, with a kind of fever on
      her, she wants to go out. She asked if it rained. &lsquo;The rain may kill me in
      these ragged clothes,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;and then I shan&rsquo;t be in the way of his
      prospects in life.&rsquo; We tried to quiet her by telling her it didn&rsquo;t rain&mdash;but
      it was no use; she was as eager as ever to go out. &lsquo;I may get another blow
      on the bosom,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;and, maybe, it will fall on the right place this
      time.&rsquo; No! there&rsquo;s no fear of the brute who used to beat her&mdash;he&rsquo;s in
      prison. Don&rsquo;t ask to see her just yet, sir; please don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m afraid you
      would only make her worse, if I took you to her now; I wouldn&rsquo;t dare to
      risk it. You see, we can&rsquo;t get her to sleep; and we thought of buying
      something to quiet her at the chemist&rsquo;s. Yes, sir, it would be better to
      get a doctor to her. But I wasn&rsquo;t going to the doctor. If I must tell you,
      I was obliged to take the sheets off the bed, to raise a little money&mdash;I
      was going to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s.&rdquo; She looked at the parcel under her arm,
      and smiled. &ldquo;I may take the sheets back again, now I&rsquo;ve met with you; and
      there&rsquo;s a good doctor lives close by&mdash;I can show you the way to him.
      Oh how pale you do look! Are you very much tired? It&rsquo;s only a little way
      to the doctor. I&rsquo;ve got an arm at your service&mdash;but you mightn&rsquo;t like
      to be seen waiting with such a person as me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mentally and physically, Amelius was completely prostrated. The woman&rsquo;s
      melancholy narrative had overwhelmed him: he could neither speak nor act.
      He mechanically put his purse in her hand, and went with her to the house
      of the nearest medical man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was at home, mixing drugs in his little surgery. After one
      sharp look at Amelius, he ran into a back parlour, and returned with a
      glass of spirits. &ldquo;Drink this, sir,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;unless you want to
      find yourself on the floor in a fainting fit. And don&rsquo;t presume again on
      your youth and strength to treat your heart as if it was made of
      cast-iron.&rdquo; He signed to Amelius to sit down and rest himself, and turned
      to the woman to hear what was wanted of him. After a few questions, he
      said she might go; promising to follow her in a few minutes, when the
      gentleman would be sufficiently recovered to accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, are you beginning to feel like yourself again?&rdquo; He was mixing
      a composing draught, while he addressed Amelius in those terms. &ldquo;You may
      trust that poor wretch, who has just left us, to take care of the sick
      girl,&rdquo; he went on, in the quaintly familiar manner which seemed to be
      habitual with him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask how you got into her company&mdash;it&rsquo;s no
      business of mine. But I am pretty well acquainted with the people in my
      neighbourhood; and I can tell you one thing, in case you&rsquo;re anxious. The
      woman who brought you here, barring the one misfortune of her life, is as
      good a creature as ever breathed; and the other one who lives with her is
      the same. When I think of what they&rsquo;re exposed to&mdash;well! I take to my
      pipe, and compose my mind in that way. My early days were all passed as a
      ship&rsquo;s surgeon. I could get them both respectable employment in Australia,
      if I only had the money to fit them out. They&rsquo;ll die in the hospital, like
      the rest, if something isn&rsquo;t done for them. In my hopeful moments, I
      sometimes think of a subscription. What do you say? Will you put down a
      few shillings to set the example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do more than that,&rdquo; Amelius answered. &ldquo;I have reasons for wishing
      to befriend both those two poor women; and I will gladly engage to find
      the outfit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The familiar old doctor held out his hand over the counter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good
      fellow, if ever there was one yet!&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;I can show references
      which will satisfy you that I am not a rogue. In the mean time, let&rsquo;s see
      what is the matter with this little girl; you can tell me about her as we
      go along.&rdquo; He put his bottle of medicine in his pocket, and his arm in the
      arm of Amelius&mdash;and so led the way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the wretched lodging-house in which the women lived, he
      suggested that his companion would do well to wait at the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m used
      to sad sights: it would only distress you to see the place. I won&rsquo;t keep
      you long waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was as good as his word. In little more than ten minutes, he joined
      Amelius again in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm yourself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The case is not so serious as it looks.
      The poor child is suffering under a severe shock to the brain and nervous
      system, caused by that sudden and violent distress you hinted at. My
      medicine will give her the one thing she wants to begin with&mdash;a good
      night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius asked when she would be well enough to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my young friend, it&rsquo;s not so easy to say, just yet! I could answer
      you to better purpose tomorrow. Won&rsquo;t that do? Must I venture on a rash
      opinion? She ought to be composed enough to see you in three or four days.
      And, when that time comes, it&rsquo;s my belief you will do more than I can do
      to set her right again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius was relieved, but not quite satisfied yet. He inquired if it was
      not possible to remove her from that miserable place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite impossible&mdash;without doing her serious injury. They have got
      money to go on with; and I have told you already, she will be well taken
      care of. I will look after her myself tomorrow morning. Go home, and get
      to bed, and eat a bit of supper first, and make your mind easy. Come to my
      house at twelve o&rsquo;clock, noon, and you will find me ready with my
      references, and my report of the patient. Surgeon Pinfold, Blackacre
      Buildings; there&rsquo;s the address. Good night.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 10
    </h2>
    <p>
      After Amelius had left him, Rufus remembered his promise to communicate
      with Regina by telegraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his strict regard for truth, it was no easy matter to decide on what
      message he should send. To inspire Regina, if possible, with his own
      unshaken belief in the good faith of Amelius, appeared, on reflection, to
      be all that he could honestly do, under present circumstances. With an
      anxious and foreboding mind, he despatched his telegram to Paris in these
      terms:&mdash;&ldquo;Be patient for a while, and do justice to A. He deserves
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having completed his business at the telegraph-office, Rufus went next to
      pay his visit to Mrs. Payson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good lady received him with a grave face and a distant manner, in
      startling contrast to the customary warmth of her welcome. &ldquo;I used to
      think you were a man in a thousand,&rdquo; she began abruptly; &ldquo;and I find you
      are no better than the rest of them. If you have come to speak to me about
      that blackguard young Socialist, understand, if you please, that I am not
      so easily imposed upon as Miss Regina. I have done my duty; I have opened
      her eyes to the truth, poor thing. Ah, you ought to be ashamed of
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus kept his temper, with his habitual self-command. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible you
      may be right,&rdquo; he said quietly; &ldquo;but the biggest rascal living has a claim
      to an explanation, when a lady puzzles him. Have you any particular
      objection, old friend, to tell me what you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The explanation was not of a nature to set his mind at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina had written, by the mail which took Rufus to England, repeating to
      Mrs. Payson what had passed at the interview in the Champs Elysees, and
      appealing to her sympathy for information and advice. Receiving the letter
      that morning, Mrs. Payson, acting on her own generous and compassionate
      impulses, had already answered it, and sent it to the post. Her experience
      of the unfortunate persons received at the Home was far from inclining her
      to believe in the innocence of a runaway girl, placed under circumstances
      of temptation. As an act of justice towards Regina, she enclosed to her
      the letter in which Amelius had acknowledged that Sally had passed the
      night under his roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am only telling you the shameful truth,&rdquo; Mrs. Payson had
      written, &ldquo;when I add that the girl has been an inmate of Mr. Goldenheart&rsquo;s
      cottage ever since. If you can reconcile this disgraceful state of things,
      with Mr. Rufus Dingwell&rsquo;s assertion of his friend&rsquo;s fidelity to his
      marriage-engagement, I have no right, and no wish, to make any attempt to
      alter your opinion. But you have asked for my advice, and I must not
      shrink from giving it. I am bound as an honest woman, to tell you that
      your uncle&rsquo;s resolution to break off the engagement represents the course
      that I should have taken myself, if a daughter of my own had been placed
      in your painful and humiliating position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was still ample time to modify this strong expression of opinion by
      the day&rsquo;s post. Rufus appealed vainly to Mrs. Payson to reconsider the
      conclusion at which she had arrived. A more charitable and considerate
      woman, within the limits of her own daily routine, it would not be
      possible to find. But the largeness of mind which, having long and
      trustworthy experience of a rule, can nevertheless understand that other
      minds may have equal experience of the exception to the rule, was one of
      the qualities which had not been included in the moral composition of Mrs.
      Payson. She held firmly to her own narrowly conscientious sense of her
      duty; stimulated by a natural indignation against Amelius, who had
      bitterly disappointed her&mdash;against Rufus, who had not scrupled to
      take up his defence. The two old friends parted in coldness, for the first
      time in their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus returned to his hotel, to wait there for news from Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed&mdash;and the one visitor who enlivened his solitude was an
      American friend and correspondent, connected with the agency which managed
      his affairs in England. The errand of this gentleman was to give his
      client the soundest and speediest advice, relating to the investment of
      money. Having indicated the safe and solid speculation, the visitor added
      a warning word, relating to the plausible and dangerous investments of the
      day. &ldquo;For instance,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s that bank started by Farnaby&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need to warn me against Farnaby,&rdquo; Rufus interposed; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t take
      shares in his bank if he made me a present of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American friend looked surprised. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t
      have heard the news already! They don&rsquo;t even know it yet on the Stock
      Exchange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus explained that he had only spoken under the influence of personal
      prejudice against Mr. Farnaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the wind now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was confidentially informed that a coming storm was in the wind: in
      other words, that a serious discovery had been made at the bank. Some time
      since, the directors had advanced a large sum of money to a man in trade,
      under Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s own guarantee. The man had just died; and examination
      of his affairs showed that he had only received a few hundred pounds, on
      condition of holding his tongue. The bulk of the money had been traced to
      Mr. Farnaby himself, and had all been swallowed up by his newspaper, his
      patent medicine, and his other rotten speculations, apart from his own
      proper business. &ldquo;You may not know it,&rdquo; the American friend concluded,
      &ldquo;but the fact is, Farnaby rose from the dregs. His bankruptcy is only a
      question of time&mdash;he will drop back to the dregs; and, quite
      possibly, make his appearance to answer a criminal charge in a court of
      law. I hear that Melton, whose credit has held up the bank lately, is off
      to see his friend in Paris. They say Farnaby&rsquo;s niece is a handsome girl,
      and Melton is sweet on her. Awkward for Melton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus listened attentively. In signing the order for his investments, he
      privately decided to stir no further, for the present, in the matter of
      his young friend&rsquo;s marriage-engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of the day and evening, he still waited for Amelius, and
      waited in vain. It was drawing near to midnight, when Toff made his
      appearance with a message from his master. Amelius had discovered Sally,
      and had returned in such a state of fatigue that he was only fit to take
      some refreshment, and to go to his bed. He would be away from home again,
      on the next morning; but he hoped to call at the hotel in the course of
      the day. Observing Toff&rsquo;s face with grave and steady scrutiny, Rufus tried
      to extract some further information from him. But the old Frenchman stood
      on his dignity, in a state of immovable reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You took me by the shoulder this morning, sir, and spun me round,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;I do not desire to be treated a second time like a teetotum. For
      the rest, it is not my habit to intrude myself into my master&rsquo;s secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <i>my</i> habit,&rdquo; Rufus coolly rejoined, &ldquo;to bear malice. I beg
      to apologise sincerely, sir, for treating you like a teetotum; and I offer
      you my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff had got as far as the door. He instantly returned, with the dignity
      which a Frenchman can always command in the serious emergencies of his
      life. &ldquo;You appeal to my heart and my honour, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I bury the
      events of the morning in oblivion; and I do myself the honour of taking
      your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed on him, Rufus smiled grimly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in the habit
      of intruding yourself into your master&rsquo;s secrets,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;If
      Amelius reads your face as I read it, he&rsquo;ll look over his shoulder when he
      goes out tomorrow&mdash;and, ten to one, he&rsquo;ll see you behind him in the
      distance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Late on the next day, Amelius presented himself at the hotel. In speaking
      of Sally, he was unusually reserved, merely saying that she was ill, and
      under medical care, and then changing the subject. Struck by the depressed
      and anxious expression of his face, Rufus asked if he had heard from
      Regina. No: a longer time than usual had passed since Regina had written
      to him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; he said sadly. &ldquo;I suppose you didn&rsquo;t see
      anything of her in Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus had kept his promise not to mention Regina&rsquo;s name in Sally&rsquo;s
      presence. But it was impossible for him to look at Amelius, without
      plainly answering the question put to him, for the sake of the friend whom
      he loved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s trouble coming to you, my son, from that
      quarter.&rdquo; With those warning words, he described all that had passed
      between Regina and himself. &ldquo;Some unknown enemy of yours has spoken
      against you to her uncle,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;I suppose you have made enemies,
      my poor old boy, since you have been in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the man,&rdquo; Amelius answered. &ldquo;He wanted to marry Regina before I
      met with her. His name is Melton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus started. &ldquo;I heard only yesterday, he was in Paris with Farnaby. And
      that&rsquo;s not the worst of it, Amelius. There&rsquo;s another of them making
      mischief&mdash;a good friend of mine who has shown a twist in her temper,
      that has taken me by surprise after twenty years&rsquo; experience of her. I
      reckon there&rsquo;s a drop of malice in the composition of the best woman that
      ever lived&mdash;and the men only discover it when another woman steps in,
      and stirs it up. Wait a bit!&rdquo; he went on, when he had related the result
      of his visit to Mrs. Payson. &ldquo;I have telegraphed to Miss Regina to be
      patient, and to trust you. Don&rsquo;t you write to defend yourself, till you
      hear how you stand in her estimation, after my message. Tomorrow&rsquo;s post
      may tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tomorrow&rsquo;s post did tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two letters reached Amelius from Paris. One from Mr. Farnaby, curt and
      insolent, breaking off the marriage-engagement. The other, from Regina,
      expressed with great severity of language. Her weak nature, like all weak
      natures, ran easily into extremes, and, once roused into asserting itself,
      took refuge in violence as a shy person takes refuge in audacity. Only a
      woman of larger and firmer mind would have written of her wrongs in a more
      just and more moderate tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina began without any preliminary form of address. She had no heart to
      upbraid Amelius, and no wish to speak of what she was suffering, to a man
      who had but too plainly shown that he had no respect for himself, and
      neither love, nor pity even, for her. In justice to herself, she released
      him from his promise, and returned his letters and his presents. Her own
      letters might be sent in a sealed packet, addressed to her at her uncle&rsquo;s
      place of business in London. She would pray that he might be brought to a
      sense of the sin that he had committed, and that he might yet live to be a
      worthy and a happy man. For the rest, her decision was irrevocable. His
      own letter to Mrs. Payson condemned him&mdash;and the testimony of an old
      and honoured friend of her uncle proved that his wickedness was no mere
      act of impulse, but a deliberate course of infamy and falsehood, continued
      over many weeks. From the moment when she made that discovery, he was a
      stranger to her&mdash;and she now bade him farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you written to her?&rdquo; Rufus asked, when he had seen the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius reddened with indignation. He was not aware of it himself&mdash;but
      his look and manner plainly revealed that Regina had lost her last hold on
      him. Her letter had inflicted an insult&mdash;not a wound: he was outraged
      and revolted; the deeper and gentler feelings, the emotions of a grieved
      and humiliated lover, had been killed in him by her stern words of
      dismissal and farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I would allow myself to be treated in that way, without a
      word of protest?&rdquo; he said to Rufus. &ldquo;I have written, refusing to take back
      my promise. &lsquo;I declare, on my word of honour, that I have been faithful to
      you and to my engagement&rsquo;&mdash;that was how I put it&mdash;&lsquo;and I scorn
      the vile construction which your uncle and his friend have placed upon an
      act of Christian mercy on my part.&rsquo; I wrote more tenderly, before I
      finished my letter; feeling for her distress, and being anxious above all
      things not to add to it. We shall see if she has love enough left for me
      to trust my faith and honour, instead of trusting false appearances. I
      will give her time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus considerately abstained from expressing any opinion. He waited until
      the morning when a reply might be expected from Paris; and then he called
      at the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word of comment, Amelius put a letter into his friend&rsquo;s hand. It
      was his own letter to Regina returned to him. On the back of it, there was
      a line in Mr. Farnaby&rsquo;s handwriting:&mdash;&ldquo;If you send any more letters
      they will be burnt unopened.&rdquo; In those insolent terms the wretch wrote
      with bankruptcy and exposure hanging over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus spoke plainly upon this. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an end of it now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That
      girl would never have made the right wife for you, Amelius: you&rsquo;re well
      out of it. Forget that you ever knew these people; and let us talk of
      something else. How is Sally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that ill-timed inquiry, Amelius showed his temper again. He was in a
      state of nervous irritability which made him apt to take offence, where no
      offence was intended. &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be alarmed!&rdquo; he answered
      petulantly; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no fear of the poor child coming back to live with
      me. She is still under the doctor&rsquo;s care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus passed over the angry reply without notice, and patted him on the
      shoulder. &ldquo;I spoke of the girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because I wanted to help her;
      and I can help her, if you will let me. Before long, my son, I shall be
      going back to the United States. I wish you would go with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And desert Sally!&rdquo; cried Amelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort! Before we go, I&rsquo;ll see that Sally is provided for to
      your satisfaction. Will you think of it, to please me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius relented. &ldquo;Anything, to please you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus noticed his hat and gloves on the table, and left him without saying
      more. &ldquo;The trouble with Amelius,&rdquo; he thought, as he closed the cottage
      gate, &ldquo;is not over yet.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 11
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day on which worthy old Surgeon Pinfold had predicted that Sally would
      be in a fair way of recovery had come and gone; and still the medical
      report to Amelius was the same:&mdash;&ldquo;You must be patient, sir; she is
      not well enough to see you yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff, watching his young master anxiously, was alarmed by the steadily
      progressive change in him for the worse, which showed itself at this time.
      Now sad and silent, and now again bitter and irritable, he had
      deteriorated physically as well as morally, until he really looked like
      the shadow of his former self. He never exchanged a word with his faithful
      old servant, except when he said mechanically, &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; or &ldquo;good
      night.&rdquo; Toff could endure it no longer. At the risk of being roughly
      misinterpreted, he followed his own kindly impulse, and spoke. &ldquo;May I own
      to you, sir,&rdquo; he said, with perfect gentleness and respect, &ldquo;that I am
      indeed heartily sorry to see you so ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked up at him sharply. &ldquo;You servants always make a fuss about
      trifles. I am a little out of sorts; and I want a change&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.
      Perhaps I may go to America. You won&rsquo;t like that; I shan&rsquo;t complain if you
      look out for another situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears came into the old man&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he answered fervently.
      &ldquo;My last service, sir, if you send me away, shall be my dearly loved
      service here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that was most tender in the nature of Amelius was touched to the
      quick. &ldquo;Forgive me, Toff,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am lonely and wretched, and more
      anxious about Sally than words can tell. There can be no change in my
      life, until my mind is easy about that poor little girl. But if it does
      end in my going to America, you shall go with me&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t lose
      you, my good friend, for the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff still remained in the room, as if he had something left to say.
      Entirely ignorant of the marriage engagement between Amelius and Regina,
      and of the rupture in which it had ended, he vaguely suspected
      nevertheless that his master might have fallen into an entanglement with
      some lady unknown. The opportunity of putting the question was now before
      him. He risked it in a studiously modest form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to America to be married, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius eyed him with a momentary suspicion. &ldquo;What has put that in your
      head?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; Toff answered humbly&mdash;&ldquo;unless it was my own
      vivid imagination. Would there be anything very wonderful in a gentleman
      of your age and appearance conducting some charming person to the altar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius was conquered once more; he smiled faintly. &ldquo;Enough of your
      nonsense, Toff! I shall never be married&mdash;understand that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff&rsquo;s withered old face brightened slyly. He turned away to withdraw;
      hesitated; and suddenly went back to his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any occasion for my services, sir, for an hour or two?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Be back before I go out, myself&mdash;be back at three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir. My little boy is below, if you want anything in my
      absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little boy dutifully attending Toff to the gate, observed with grave
      surprise that his father snapped his fingers gaily at starting, and hummed
      the first bars of the Marseillaise. &ldquo;Something is going to happen,&rdquo; said
      Toff&rsquo;s boy, on his way back to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Regent&rsquo;s Park to Blackacre Buildings is almost a journey from one
      end of London to the other. Assisted for part of the way by an omnibus,
      Toff made the journey, and arrived at the residence of Surgeon Pinfold,
      with the easy confidence of a man who knew thoroughly well where he was
      going, and what he was about. The sagacity of Rufus had correctly
      penetrated his intentions; he had privately followed his master, and had
      introduced himself to the notice of the surgeon&mdash;with a mixture of
      motives, in which pure devotion to the interests of Amelius played the
      chief part. His experience of the world told him that Sally&rsquo;s departure
      was only the beginning of more trouble to come. &ldquo;What is the use of me to
      my master,&rdquo; he had argued, &ldquo;except to spare him trouble, in spite of
      himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surgeon Pinfold was prescribing for a row of sick people, seated before
      him on a bench. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not ill, are you?&rdquo; he said sharply to Toff. &ldquo;Very
      well, then, go into the parlour and wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patients being dismissed, Toff attempted to explain the object of his
      visit. But the old naval surgeon insisted on clearing the ground by means
      of a plain question first. &ldquo;Has your master sent you here&mdash;or is this
      another private interview, like the last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all that is most private,&rdquo; Toff answered; &ldquo;my poor master is
      wasting away in unrelieved wretchedness and suspense. Something must be
      done for him. Oh, dear and good sir, help me in this most miserable state
      of things! Tell me the truth about Miss Sally!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Pinfold put his hands in his pockets and leaned against the parlour
      wall, looking at the Frenchman with a complicated expression, in which
      genuine sympathy mingled oddly with a quaint sense of amusement. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
      worthy chap,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and you shall have the truth. I have been obliged
      to deceive your master about this troublesome young Sally; I have stuck to
      it that she is too ill to see him, or to answer his letters. Both lies.
      There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with her now, but a disease that I can&rsquo;t cure,
      the disease of a troubled mind. She&rsquo;s got it into her head that she has
      everlastingly degraded herself in his estimation by leaving him and coming
      here. It&rsquo;s no use telling her&mdash;what, mind you, is perfectly true&mdash;that
      she was all but out of her senses, and not in the least responsible for
      what she did at the time when she did it. She holds to her own opinion,
      nevertheless. &lsquo;What can he think of me, but that I have gone back
      willingly to the disgrace of my old life? I should throw myself out of the
      window, if he came into the room!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s how she answers me&mdash;and,
      what makes matters worse still, she&rsquo;s breaking her heart about him all the
      time. The poor wretch is so eager for any little word of news about his
      health and his doings, that it&rsquo;s downright pitiable to see her. I don&rsquo;t
      think her fevered little brain will bear it much longer&mdash;and hang me
      if I can tell what to do next to set things right! The two women, her
      friends, have no sort of influence over her. When I saw her this morning,
      she was ungrateful enough to say, &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let me die?&rsquo; How your
      master got among these unfortunate people is more than I know, and is no
      business of mine; I only wish he had been a different sort of man. Before
      I knew him as well as I know him now, I predicted, like a fool, that he
      would be just the person to help us in managing the girl. I have altered
      my opinion. He&rsquo;s such a glorious fellow&mdash;so impulsive and so
      tender-hearted&mdash;that he would be certain, in her present excited
      state, to do her more harm than good. Do you know if he is going to be
      married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff, listening thus far in silent distress, suddenly looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask me, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an idle question, I dare say,&rdquo; old Pinfold remarked. &ldquo;Sally persists
      in telling us she&rsquo;s in the way of his prospects in life&mdash;and it&rsquo;s got
      somehow into her perverse little head that his prospects in life mean his
      marriage, and she&rsquo;s in the way of <i>that.</i>&mdash;Hullo! are you going
      already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go to Miss Sally, sir. I believe I can say something to comfort
      her. Do you think she will see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the man who has got the nickname of Toff? She sometimes talks
      about Toff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, yes! I am Theophile Leblond, otherwise Toff. Where can I find
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surgeon Pinfold rang a bell. &ldquo;My errand-boy is going past the house, to
      deliver some medicine,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a poor place; but you&rsquo;ll find
      it neat and nice enough&mdash;thanks to your good master. He&rsquo;s helping the
      two women to begin life again out of this country; and, while they&rsquo;re
      waiting their turn to get a passage, they&rsquo;ve taken an extra room and hired
      some decent furniture, by your master&rsquo;s own wish. Oh, here&rsquo;s the boy;
      he&rsquo;ll show you the way. One word before you go. What do you think of
      saying to Sally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell her, for one thing, sir, that my master is miserable for
      want of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surgeon Pinfold shook his head. &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t take you very far on the way
      to persuading her. You will make <i>her</i> miserable too&mdash;and
      there&rsquo;s about all you will get by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff lifted his indicative forefinger to the side of his nose. &ldquo;Suppose I
      tell her something else, sir? Suppose I tell her my master is not going to
      be married to anybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t believe you know anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will believe, for this reason,&rdquo; said Toff, gravely; &ldquo;I put the
      question to my master before I came here; and I have it from his own lips
      that there is no young lady in the way, and that he is not&mdash;positively
      not&mdash;going to be married. If I tell Miss Sally this, sir, how do you
      say it will end? Will you bet me a shilling it has no effect on her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t bet a farthing! Follow the boy&mdash;and tell young Sally I have
      sent her a better doctor than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Toff was on his way to Sally, Toff&rsquo;s boy was disturbing Amelius by
      the announcement of a visitor. The card sent in bore this inscription:
      &ldquo;Brother Bawkwell, from Tadmor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius looked at the card; and ran into the hall to receive the visitor,
      with both hands held out in hearty welcome. &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad to see you!&rdquo;
       he cried. &ldquo;Come in, and tell me all about Tadmor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brother Bawkwell acknowledged the enthusiastic reception offered to him by
      a stare of grim surprise. He was a dry, hard old man, with a scrubby white
      beard, a narrow wrinkled forehead, and an obstinate lipless mouth; fitted
      neither by age nor temperament to be the intimate friend of any of his
      younger brethren among the Community. But, at that saddest time of his
      life, the heart of Amelius warmed to any one who reminded him of his
      tranquil and happy days at Tadmor. Even this frozen old Socialist now
      appeared to him, for the first time, under the borrowed aspect of a
      welcome friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Bawkwell took the chair offered to him, and opened the
      proceedings, in solemn silence, by looking at his watch. &ldquo;Twenty-five
      minutes past two,&rdquo; he said to himself&mdash;and put the watch back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you pressed for time?&rdquo; Amelius asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much may be done in ten minutes,&rdquo; Brother Bawkwell answered, in a Scotch
      accent which had survived the test of half a lifetime in America. &ldquo;I would
      have you know I am in England on a mission from the Community, with a list
      of twenty-seven persons in all, whom I am appointed to confer with on
      matters of varying importance. Yours, friend Amelius, is a matter of minor
      importance. I can give you ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened a big black pocket-book, stuffed with a mass of letters; and,
      placing two of them on the table before him, addressed Amelius as if he
      was making a speech at a public meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to request your attention to certain proceedings of the Council at
      Tadmor, bearing date the third of December last; and referring to a person
      under sentence of temporary separation from the Community, along with
      yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mellicent!&rdquo; Amelius exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no time for interruptions,&rdquo; Brother Bawkwell remarked. &ldquo;The
      person <i>is</i> Sister Mellicent; and the business before the Council was
      to consider a letter, under her signature, received December second. Said
      letter,&rdquo; he proceeded, taking up one of his papers, &ldquo;is abridged as
      follows by the Secretary to the Council. In substance, the writer states
      (first): &lsquo;That the married sister under whose protection she has been
      living at New York is about to settle in England with her husband,
      appointed to manage the branch of his business established in London.
      (Second): That she, meaning Sister Mellicent, has serious reasons for not
      accompanying her relatives to England, and has no other friends to take
      charge of her welfare, if she remains in New York. (Third): That she
      appeals to the mercy of the Council, under these circumstances, to accept
      the expression of her sincere repentance for the offence of violating a
      Rule, and to permit a friendless and penitent creature to return to the
      only home left to her, her home at Tadmor.&rsquo; No, friend Amelius&mdash;we
      have no time for expressions of sympathy; the first half of the ten
      minutes has nearly expired. I have further to notify you that the question
      was put to the vote, in this form: &lsquo;Is it consistent with the serious
      responsibility which rests on the Council, to consider the remission of
      any sentence justly pronounced under the Book of Rules?&rsquo; The result was
      very remarkable; the votes for and against being equally divided. In this
      event, as you know, our laws provide that the decision rests with the
      Elder Brother&mdash;who gave his vote thereupon for considering the
      remission of the sentence; and moved the next resolution that the sentence
      be remitted accordingly. Carried by a small majority. Whereupon, Sister
      Mellicent was received again at Tadmor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the dear old Elder Brother,&rdquo; cried Amelius&mdash;&ldquo;always on the side
      of mercy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brother Bawkwell held up his hand in protest. &ldquo;You seem to have no idea,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;of the value of time. Do be quiet! As travelling representative
      of the Council, I am further instructed to say, that the sentence
      pronounced against yourself stands duly remitted, in consequence of the
      remission of the sentence against Sister Mellicent. You likewise are free
      to return to Tadmor, at your own will and pleasure. But&mdash;attend to
      what is coming, friend Amelius!&mdash;the Council holds to its resolution
      that your choice between us and the world shall be absolutely unbiased. In
      the fear of exercising even an indirect influence, we have purposely
      abstained from corresponding with you. With the same motive we now say,
      that if you do return to us, it must be with no interference on our part.
      We inform you of an event that has happened in your absence&mdash;and we
      do no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and looked again at his watch. Time proverbially works wonders.
      Time closed his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius replied with a heavy heart. The message from the Council had
      recalled him from the remembrance of Mellicent to the sense of his own
      position. &ldquo;My experience of the world has been a very hard one,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I would gladly go back to Tadmor this very day, but for one consideration&mdash;&rdquo;
       He hesitated; the image of Sally was before him. The tears rose in his
      eyes; he said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Bawkwell, driven hard by time, got on his legs, and handed to
      Amelius the second of the two papers which he had taken out of his
      pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a purely informal document,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;being a few lines from
      Sister Mellicent, which I was charged to deliver to you. Be pleased to
      read it as quickly as you can, and tell me if there is any reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not much to read:&mdash;&ldquo;The good people here, Amelius, have
      forgiven me and let me return to them. I am living happily now, dear, in
      my remembrances of you. I take the walks that we once took together&mdash;and
      sometimes I go out in the boat on the lake, and think of the time when I
      told you my sad story. Your poor little pet creatures are under my care;
      the dog, and the fawn, and the birds&mdash;all well, and waiting for you,
      with me. My belief that you will come back to me remains the same unshaken
      belief that it has been from the first. Once more I say it&mdash;you will
      find me the first to welcome you, when your spirits are sinking under the
      burden of life, and your heart turns again to the friends of your early
      days. Until that time comes, think of me now and then. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting,&rdquo; said Brother Bawkwell, taking his hat in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius answered with an effort. &ldquo;Thank her kindly in my name,&rdquo; he said:
      &ldquo;that is all.&rdquo; His head drooped while he spoke; he fell into thought as if
      he had been alone in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the emissary from Tadmor, warned by the minute-hand on the watch,
      recalled his attention to passing events. &ldquo;You would do me a kindness,&rdquo;
       said Brother Bawkwell, producing a list of names and addresses, &ldquo;if you
      could put me in the way of finding the person named, eighth from the top.
      It&rsquo;s getting on towards twenty minutes to three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The address thus pointed out was at no great distance, on the northern
      side of the Regent&rsquo;s Park. Amelius, still silent and thoughtful, acted
      willingly as a guide. &ldquo;Please thank the Council for their kindness to me,&rdquo;
       he said, when they reached their destination. Brother Bawkwell looked at
      friend Amelius with a calm inquiring eye. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll end in coming
      back to us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the opportunity, when I see you at
      Tadmor, of making a few needful remarks on the value of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amelius went back to the cottage, to see if Toff had returned, in his
      absence, before he paid his daily visit to Surgeon Pinfold. He called down
      the kitchen stairs, &ldquo;Are you there, Toff?&rdquo; And Toff answered briskly, &ldquo;At
      your service, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sky had become cloudy, and threatened rain. Not finding his umbrella
      in the hall, Amelius went into the library to look for it. As he closed
      the door behind him, Toff and his boy appeared on the kitchen stairs; both
      walking on tiptoe, and both evidently on the watch for something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amelius found his umbrella. But it was characteristic of the melancholy
      change in him that he dropped languidly into the nearest chair, instead of
      going out at once with the easy activity of happier days. Sally was in his
      mind again; he was rousing his resolution to set the doctor&rsquo;s commands at
      defiance, and to insist on seeing her, come what might of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly looked up. A slight sound had startled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a faint rustling sound; and it came from the sadly silent room
      which had once been Sally&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened, and heard it again. He sprang to his feet&mdash;his heart
      beat wildly&mdash;he opened the door of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands were clasped over her fast-heaving breast. She was powerless to
      look at him, powerless to speak to him&mdash;powerless to move towards
      him, until he opened his arms to her. Then, all the love and all the
      sorrow in the tender little heart flowed outward to him in a low murmuring
      cry. She hid her blushing face on his bosom. The rosy colour softly tinged
      her neck&mdash;the unspoken confession of all she feared, and all she
      hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a time beyond words. They were silent in each other&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But under them, on the floor below, the stillness in the cottage was
      merrily broken by an outburst of dance-music&mdash;with a rhythmical
      thump-thump of feet, keeping time to the cheerful tune. Toff was playing
      his fiddle; and Toff&rsquo;s boy was dancing to his father&rsquo;s music.

      CHAPTER 12
    </h2>
    <p>
      After waiting a day or two for news from Amelius, and hearing nothing,
      Rufus went to make inquiries at the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My master has gone out of town, sir,&rdquo; said Toff, opening the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news of Sally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus stepped into the hall. &ldquo;Look here, Mr. Frenchman, three times is
      enough. I have already apologized for treating you like a teetotum, on a
      former occasion. I&rsquo;m afraid I shall do it again, sir, if I don&rsquo;t get an
      answer to my next question&mdash;my hands are itching to be at you, they
      are! When is Amelius expected back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your question is positive, sir,&rdquo; said Toff, with dignity. &ldquo;I am happy to
      be able to meet it with a positive reply. My master is expected back in
      three weeks&rsquo; time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having obtained some information at last, Rufus debated with himself what
      he should do next. He decided that &ldquo;the boy was worth waiting for,&rdquo; and
      that his wisest course (as a good American) would be to go back, and wait
      in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through the Garden of the Tuileries, two or three days later, and
      crossing to the Rue de Rivoli, the name of one of the hotels in that
      quarter reminded him of Regina. He yielded to the prompting of curiosity,
      and inquired if Mr. Farnaby and his niece were still in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager of the hotel was in the porter&rsquo;s lodge at the time. So far as
      he knew, he said, Mr. Farnaby and his niece, and an English gentleman with
      them, were now on their travels. They had left the hotel with an
      appearance of mystery. The courier had been discharged; and the coachman
      of the hired carriage which took them away had been told to drive straight
      forward until further orders. In short, as the manager put it, the
      departure resembled a flight. Remembering what his American agent had told
      him, Rufus received this information without surprise. Even the apparently
      incomprehensible devotion of Mr. Melton to the interests of such a man as
      Farnaby, failed to present itself to him as a perplexing circumstance. To
      his mind, Mr. Melton&rsquo;s conduct was plainly attributable to a reward in
      prospect; and the name of that reward was&mdash;Miss Regina.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the three weeks, Rufus returned to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, he and Toff confronted each other on the threshold of the
      door. This time, the genial old man presented an appearance that was
      little less than dazzling. From head to foot he was arrayed in new
      clothes; and he exhibited an immense rosette of white ribbon in his
      button-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder!&rdquo; cried Rufus. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mr. Frenchman going to be married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff declined to humour the joke. He stood on his dignity as stiffly as
      ever. &ldquo;Pardon me, sir, I possess a wife and family already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, now? Well&mdash;none of your know-nothing answers this time. Has
      Amelius come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s the news of Sally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news, sir. Miss Sally has come back too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call that good news, do you? I&rsquo;ll say a word to Amelius. What are you
      standing there for? Let me by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me once more, sir. My master and Miss Sally do not receive
      visitors today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your master and Miss Sally?&rdquo; Rufus repeated. &ldquo;Has this old creature been
      liquoring up a little too freely? What do you mean,&rdquo; he burst out, with a
      sudden change of tone to stern surprise&mdash;&ldquo;what do you mean by putting
      your master and Sally together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toff shot his bolt at last. &ldquo;They will be together, sir, for the rest of
      their lives. They were married this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rufus received the blow in dead silence. He turned about, and went back to
      his hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching his room, he opened the despatch box in which he kept his
      correspondence, and picked out the long letter containing the description
      by Amelius of his introduction to the ladies of the Farnaby family. He
      took up the pen, and wrote the indorsement which has been quoted as an
      integral part of the letter itself, in the Second Book of this narrative:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, poor Amelius! He had better have gone back to Miss Mellicent, and put
      up with the little drawback of her age. What a bright lovable fellow he
      was! Goodbye to Goldenheart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Were the forebodings of Rufus destined to be fulfilled? This question will
      be answered, it is hoped, in a Second Series of The Fallen Leaves. The
      narrative of the married life of Amelius presents a subject too important
      to be treated within the limits of the present story&mdash;and the First
      Series necessarily finds its end in the culminating event of his life,
      thus far.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
